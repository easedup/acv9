# History - Year 7 {#history-year-7}

## Level Description {#level-description}

The Year 7 curriculum provides a study of history from the time of the earliest human communities to the end of the ancient period, approximately 60,000 years ago – c.650 (CE), and a study of early First Nations Peoples of Australia. It was a period defined by the development of cultural practices and organised societies. The study of the ancient world includes the discoveries (the remains of the past and what we know) and the mysteries (what we do not know) about this period of history, in a range of societies from places including Egypt, Greece, Rome, India and China.

An overview of the study of the ancient world's earliest societies requires students to develop a broad understanding of the context and chronology of the period, the patterns of historical continuity and change over time, and related historical themes. This includes understanding the archaeological and historical terms used to describe different periods of time, and the ways different cultures, including First Nations Australians, identify and represent time.

In Year 7, students are expected to study the sub-strand _Deep time history of Australia_ and at least one of the topics from _The ancient world_ sub-strand. _The ancient world_ sub-strand topics are:

*   Greece
*   Rome
*   Egypt
*   India
*   China.

Inquiry questions provide a framework for developing students’ knowledge, understanding and skills. The following inquiry questions are examples only and may be used or adapted to suit local contexts.

*   How do we know about the ancient past?
*   Why, where and when did the earliest societies develop?
*   What emerged as the distinctive features of societies of early First Nations Peoples of Australia?
*   What emerged as the defining features and achievements of ancient societies?
*   What have been the significant legacies of ancient societies?
