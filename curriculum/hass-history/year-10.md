# History - Year 10 {#history-year-10}

## Level Description {#level-description}

The Year 10 curriculum provides a study of the history of the modern world and Australia from 1918 to the present, with an emphasis on Australia in its global context. The 20th century became a critical period in Australia’s social, political, economic, cultural, environmental and political development. The transformation of the modern world during a time of political turmoil, global conflict and international cooperation provides a necessary context for understanding Australia’s development, its place within the Asia-Pacific region and its global standing, and the demands for rights and recognition by First Nations Australians.

An overview of the study of the modern world and Australia requires students to develop an understanding of the context and chronology of the period, and the broad patterns of historical continuity and change from 1918, such as significant events and ideas during the inter-war years between the First World War and the Second World War, including the Great Depression, and developments post the Second World War, including Cold War international relations. It also involves understanding related historical themes of the post-Second World War world and how they relate to Australia, such as the major rights and freedom movements globally, and the achievement of independence by former colonies, both of which contributed to Australia's migrant experience.

In Year 10, students are expected to study at least 2 sub-strands: the _Second World War_ and _Building Modern Australia_. _The globalising world_ is a sub-strand that may be studied as an option.

Inquiry questions provide a framework for developing students’ knowledge, understanding and skills. The following inquiry questions are examples only and may be used or adapted to suit local contexts.

*   How did the nature of global conflict change across the 20th century?
*   What were the causes and consequences of the Second World War? How did these consequences shape the modern world?
*   How was Australian society affected by other significant global events and changes in this period?
*   What were the perspectives of people at the time? How did these perspectives change?
*   What are the contested debates and reasons for different historical interpretations?
