# History - Year 9 {#history-year-9}

## Level Description {#level-description}

The Year 9 curriculum provides a study of the history of the making of the modern world from 1750 to 1918. This was a period of industrialisation and rapid change in the ways people lived, worked and thought. It was an era of nationalism and imperialism, and expansion of European power, which had significant effects on First Nations Peoples globally. The period culminated in World War I (1914–1918), the “war to end all wars”.

An overview of the study of the making of the modern world requires students to develop an understanding of the context and chronology of the period, and the broad patterns of historical continuity and change from 1750 to 1918, such as European imperial expansion and the movement of peoples within and between countries, and the impact this had on the Australian continent. This includes being introduced to the significant economic, social and political ideas that developed and caused change in groups and in societies, and some of the significant individuals and groups who promoted these ideas.

In Year 9, students are expected to study the sub-strand _Making and transforming the Australian nation (1750–1914)_ and the sub-strand _First World War (1914–1918)_. _The Industrial Revolution and movement of peoples (1750–1900)_ and the _Asia and the World (1750–1914)_ sub-strands may be studied as options.

Inquiry questions provide a framework for developing students’ knowledge, understanding and skills. The following inquiry questions are examples only and may be used or adapted to suit local contexts.

*   What are the significant events, ideas, individuals and groups that caused change from 1750 to 1918?
*   What were the causes, developments, significance and long-term effects of imperialism in this period?
*   What were the causes and significance of First World War?
*   What were the perspectives of different people at the time?
*   What are the contested debates and reasons for different historical interpretations?
