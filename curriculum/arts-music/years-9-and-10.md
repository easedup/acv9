# Music - Years 9 and 10 {#music-years-9-and-10}

## Level Description {#level-description}

In this band, learning in Music continues to build on each student’s prior learning and experiences as students develop their capability and confidence across the practices of Music: listening, composing and performing. They continue to use music knowledge and skills in purposeful and creative ways that are informed by their engagement with the work of living composers and performers from local, regional, national and global contexts such as countries or regions in Asia, including use of music in multi-arts, trans-disciplinary or hybrid forms. This awareness of diverse music practices, genres and/or styles informs their own music practices. They work collaboratively with peers and teachers.

In this band, the focus is on students:

1.  exploring and responding to

*   music and music practices and contexts from a range of cultures, times and places; for example, through listening and evaluating their own music practices or analysing performances and compositions created or presented by others
*   ways in which music created and/or performed by First Nations Australians celebrates and challenges multiple perspectives of Australian identity

3.  developing practices and skills

*   building and extending creative practices for listening, including aural skills, vocal and/or instrumental performance, and composition in music genres and/or styles of interest, interpreting and manipulating the elements of music: duration/time (for example, beat and rhythm, tempo, pulse, simple/compound metre, syncopation), pitch, dynamics and expression, form and structure, timbre and texture
*   building and extending critical practices by taking opportunities to reflect, evaluate or respond to their own work and/or the work of others; for example, considering how to apply knowledge of music genres/styles or structures in compositions, developing interpretations of music composed by others or evaluating their own performances

5.  composing in genres/forms such as songwriting, solo and/or ensemble instrumental music, music production, arranging or re-imagining, and developing interpretations of solo and/or ensemble music works for performance, using aural skills and/or available digital tools as appropriate
6.  presenting performances to audiences; for example, for a specific target audience.

## Strands {#strands}

### Exploring and responding {#exploring-and-responding}

##### AC9AMU10E01 {#ac9amu10e01}

investigate composers’ and/or performers’ use of elements of music, compositional devices and/or vocal/instrumental techniques in music from a range of cultures, times, places and/or other contexts

**Elaborations**
*  investigating ways that composers and/or performers use the elements of music and compositional devices, and work collaboratively to communicate ideas and create effects to influence or evoke an emotional response in audiences; for example, observing/reviewing performances and focusing on how elements of music and compositional devices are used to structure compositions (use of scales, modes, motifs, riffs, hooks, etc. within song forms) or how composers and/or performers manipulate elements of music to evoke an emotional response in songs, music for games, street music styles or film music
*  investigating how composers and performers use instrumentation or instrumental techniques; for example, considering how dynamics and expressive techniques are being used or manipulated to communicate specific effects, such as style-specific effects or extended techniques, by listening to a diverse range of music and comparing use of techniques or treatment of specific elements of music
*  comparing ways that people in a range of times, places and/or other contexts have used music in times of conflict and change
*  reflecting on why music might be described as “experimental”; for example, investigating the work of composers and/or performers who combine vocal/instrumental techniques developed at different times or in different cultures to create a personal sound/style; for example, composers/performers who use techniques such as hammer-ons and pull-offs when playing bowed string instruments
*  investigating the way elements of music are manipulated in music or sound designs composed for use in installations or site-specific artworks
*  discussing and evaluating the influence of music on the development of personal or social identity (for example ways music is used to influence or create a sense of belonging), and analysing how different traditions, styles and contexts affect the way people respond to the music; then using this analysis to inform the creation of a new piece of music
*  using Viewpoints to ask questions, such as, “How has the rise of technology changed music styles or the ways composers and performers work?” or “How has technology impacted on audiences, the music industry and the way we consume music?” when considering how composers and/or performers develop their personal style and/or work collaboratively

##### AC9AMU10E02 {#ac9amu10e02}

investigate the ways that First Nations Australian performers and/or composers celebrate and challenge multiple perspectives of Australian identity through music

**Elaborations**
*  evaluating innovation in the ways that First Nations Australian composers and/or performers are contributing to Australian contemporary music, including inter-cultural collaborations
*  investigating how First Nations Australian songwriters, performers and/or composers working in genres such as choral, orchestral or chamber music use music to share knowledge, educate, protest, advocate for change or express opinions or beliefs
*  evaluating intentions/motivations in music composed by and/or performed by First Nations Australians that challenges people to take action on issues such as climate change, environmental protection, social justice, racism or youth homelessness; for example, music presented in a themed performance program
*  using and annotating a map of First Nations Australian language groups to identify where First Nations Australian composers and/or performers are working and providing short descriptions of their music

### Developing practices and skills {#developing-practices-and-skills}

##### AC9AMU10D01 {#ac9amu10d01}

develop, practise and refine the use of listening/aural skills and style-specific vocal instrumental skills/techniques to interpret music and communicate expressive effects

**Elaborations**
*  working collaboratively to develop ensemble skills, such as listening carefully to establish and maintain balance across parts; for example, when performing in a duo, trio, acoustic or amplified ensemble
*  identifying challenging sections in music they are learning and developing necessary techniques and stamina to control performance, achieve accuracy and fluency, and communicate stylistic understanding
*  mapping a planned approach to interpret dynamics; for example, using observations from another performance or analysis of the work, and identifying sections/points where the loudest and softest dynamics will be employed; then practising to realise the plan
*  developing technical and expressive facility and control when using voice and/or instrument/s; for example, undertaking a systematic approach to developing and extending vocal or instrumental skills

##### AC9AMU10D02 {#ac9amu10d02}

reflect on their own and others’ music to inform choices they make as composers and performers about how they will interpret and/or manipulate elements of music and/or compositional devices

**Elaborations**
*  listening to, analysing and comparing the performance practices of others to shape and refine their own interpretation and performance of a piece of music; for example, listening and analysing to identify how other performers develop facility in using specific techniques or achieving specific effects, such as tone colour or phrasing; then evaluating preferences and developing practice strategies to achieve their own goals
*  using listening, aural skills and understanding of the information provided in scores, charts or lead-sheets to develop interpretations of repertoire in a range of styles
*  using focused listening, aural or memory skills to identify, sing or play and/or notate/document music ideas, such as pitch and rhythm patterns, intervals and common chord progressions, for future use in compositions and/or performances
*  developing and refining use of aural skills relating to tuning/intonation that they can use in real-time to improve levels of accuracy and control when performing

### Creating and making {#creating-and-making}

##### AC9AMU10C01 {#ac9amu10c01}

interpret music in a variety of forms and styles, manipulating the elements of music and/or compositional devices, and using style-specific vocal/instrumental techniques to communicate ideas, perspectives and/or meaning

**Elaborations**
*  rehearsing and refining their ability to control technical and expressive qualities in solo and/or ensemble music to achieve accuracy and fluency, and to communicate stylistic understanding
*  experimenting with and comparing how the elements of music and compositional devices are used to communicate musical intentions in traditional, digital or graphic scores from different styles; for example, listening and evaluating approaches used by other performers and trialling options or asking questions such as “Which approach best communicates my intentions or the composer’s intention?”
*  identifying stylistic conventions relevant to music they are learning, planning and practising to apply the conventions (as relevant) in their performance of music in that/those styles; for example, using information from composer/s, performers or analysis undertaken by other musicians or commentators
*  selecting, interpreting and practising a performance program that focuses on a particular theme (social or historical), music style or the work of a composer or performer/s; for example, a solo or ensemble program

##### AC9AMU10C02 {#ac9amu10c02}

compose music, manipulating and combining elements of music and compositional devices relevant to chosen styles and/or forms to communicate ideas, perspectives and/or meaning and notate, document and/or record the music

**Elaborations**
*  evaluating how different traditions, styles or contexts affect the way people respond to a piece of music; and using this information to compose a new piece of music designed to appeal to a specific audience or fulfill a specific purpose
*  experimenting with options for using instrumentation, dynamics and expressive techniques to develop the texture of a composition
*  working collaboratively to compose songs or instrumental music; for example, a song cycle, music theatre work or music for a film, animation or video game, or music that explores issues related to an historical or current event
*  applying an aural understanding of key and tonality when improvising or composing
*  experimenting with ways to combine and manipulate the elements of music and using style-specific compositional devices to develop and shape or extend compositions

rehearse and present planned performances of music they have learnt and/or composed, using relevant vocal/instrumental techniques and performance skills

**Elaborations**
*  recording and evaluating performances using digital tools; for example, listening to a recording of their own performances and identifying areas for improvement
*  performing their own music compositions and, as appropriate, using scores or visual material and reflecting on/evaluating personal or audience responses to the music; for example, asking questions such as, “How did choices such as tempo, dynamics, articulation or instrumentation allow the ensemble to achieve intended effects in their performance?”
*  rehearsing and presenting planned performances, and then reflecting on and evaluating how each performance may have been different, which was more successful with audiences, and why
*  planning and presenting performances in a range of physical or virtual spaces, including providing audiences with information about the music, the performers and the ideas that the performers are intending to communicate

## Achievement Standards {#achievement-standards}

By the end of Year 10, students analyse ways composers and/or performers use the elements of music and compositional devices to engage audiences. They evaluate how music and/or performances in a range of styles and/or from across cultures, times, places and/or other contexts communicate ideas, perspectives and/or meaning. They evaluate how music is used to celebrate and challenge perspectives of Australian identity.
Students demonstrate listening and aural skills relevant to the styles and/or contexts in which they are working. Students manipulate elements of music and use compositional devices to communicate ideas, perspectives and/or meaning in compositions in selected style/s, form/s and/or using selected instrumentation. They notate, document and/or record their music. They apply knowledge of styles and/or forms when performing their own and/or others’ music.
