# Music - Years 3 and 4 {#music-years-3-and-4}

## Level Description {#level-description}

In this band, learning in The Arts builds on each student’s prior learning and experiences. Arts learning in this band continues to use purposeful and creative play-based activities that foster development of students’ identity and wellbeing and their connection with and contribution to the world. Students further develop their capability and confidence in using subject-specific skills and creative and critical practices. They work individually and in collaboration with peers and teachers.

Students continue to explore music that they experience at home, school or through family and community events. They connect with composers and/or performers who live and work in the community; for example, by experiencing live and/or virtual performances. They use stimulus materials such as images, events, texts, questions and/or observations as inspiration for their own making and responding. These experiences support students to develop aesthetic knowledge across cognitive, sensory, emotive and physical domains, and to value arts works and practices from diverse places and cultures such as countries or cultures in Asia.

In this band, the focus is on students:

1.  exploring and responding to

*   music that showcases the range of purposes music is composed and performed for across cultures, times and places, for example, listening to, singing/playing children’s songs/game songs/storytelling/narrative songs from a range of cultures, times and places or exploring how music is used in media and popular culture
*   examples of music composed and/or performed by First Nations Australians that communicate connection to and responsibility for Country/Place

3.  developing creative and critical practices and skills

*   creative practices for composing and performing such as skills for listening, singing and playing instruments, and, as appropriate, using notation, for example, graphic notation
*   critical practices by observing, reflecting on and responding to music they experience (including music they compose and perform)

5.  composing, singing and playing instruments using the elements of music such as duration/time (beat and rhythm, tempo, pulse), pitch, dynamics and expression, texture and/or timbre
6.  performing music have learnt and/or composed in informal settings such as spaces within the school.

### Exploring and responding {#exploring-and-responding}

##### AC9AMU4E01 {#ac9amu4e01}

explore where, why and how music is composed and/or performed across cultures, times, places and/or other contexts

**Elaborations**
*  exploring examples of music created for similar purposes across different times and/or places, such as music for dancing, songs that communicate messages (health/wellbeing/identity messages), feelings or emotions (how the songwriter feels about a person or place) or knowledge (narrative songs/songs that tell stories) and asking questions about how elements of music are used; for example, “Can I identify and clap the main rhythmic pattern or sing the melody in this song?”, “Which instruments are being used in the performance and are they the ‘original’ instruments the composer intended would be used?”
*  examining the purpose for which music is used in their lives and community; for example, identifying and listening to music performed by a local choir or cultural group and responding to it (by sharing what they like, find interesting or would like to know more about in the music; describing how the music makes them feel)
*  comparing the expectations and requirements of performers and audiences in different performance settings; for example, discussing when it is acceptable to talk, dance or clap during a performance
*  exploring ways of notating or documenting forms of music, such as graphic notation, lead-sheets (lyrics, melody and/or harmony/chords), using visual images or staff notation and/or using music terminology, identifying and explaining how each type of notation/documentation conveys information to performers
*  exploring ways to make instruments from a range of materials; for example, using recycled/repurposed materials to construct instruments that produce sounds across a range of pitches and/or tone colours and effects; for example, cardboard tubes filled with cotton and rice, or food wrappers scrunched up loosely in recycled plastic bags; then using these instruments to create Foley sounds for a soundscape to accompany an exhibition of sculpture made from recycled/repurposed materials

##### AC9AMU4E02 {#ac9amu4e02}

explore how First Nations Australians use music to communicate their connection to and responsibility for Country/Place

**Elaborations**
*  examining a diverse range of music composed and/or performed by First Nations Australians to communicate connection to, and responsibility for Country/Place; for example, listening to music such as songs with lyrics about Country/Place or music used to accompany dances that communicate knowledge about Country/Place
*  listening to and exploring music that shares feelings and ideas about the importance of Country/Place and Story for First Nations Australians as a starting point for talking about different ways of seeing the same place and telling stories through music
*  learning from First Nations Australians about how they use music to communicate their connection to, and responsibility for Country/Place, culture and people; for example, resources created or co-created by First Nations Australians, such as interviews/podcasts that feature First Nations Australians talking about their music and/or performances
*  learning from First Nations Australians about the expectations and requirements of performers and audiences who are performing/experiencing music that communicates connection to, and responsibility for Country/Place, such as music used during a Welcome to Country

### Developing practices and skills {#developing-practices-and-skills}

##### AC9AMU4D01 {#ac9amu4d01}

develop listening skills and skills for manipulating elements of music when singing and playing instruments

**Elaborations**
*  using speaking, singing, voice/vocalisation and movement to develop skills for singing/vocalisation; for example, breathing, awareness of pitch, beat and rhythm, ensuring that the audience can hear/follow the lyrics when singers are singing softly, learning how to sing louder without shouting
*  manipulating elements of music to create and control intended effects, using sounds from a range of sources, such as voice/vocalisation, classroom instruments, found objects or digital instruments; for example, varying dynamics in repeated sections to create interest or using different instruments/combinations of instruments to create a particular mood or feeling, using combinations of steps and jumps (close/wide intervals) in a melody to suit different sections of the lyrics
*  singing and playing learnt pitch and rhythm patterns and varying elements of music within them to create different effects; for example, singing softer or louder, faster or slower, repeating phrases, extending or shortening rhythmic values
*  listening to the effects they create by manipulating elements of music in different ways and discussing how easy/difficult different choices are to perform accurately; asking questions such as “What works and why” (noting that there may be a range of responses across the class)
*  listening to diverse examples of music to explore how rhythm and pitch patterns, structures or timbres are used; for example, listening to identify whether a rhythmic or melodic pattern is repeated in every bar/measure or used only in a specific section, such as the verse or chorus
*  practising reading staff, graphic and/or invented notation as they rehearse and perform
*  exploring options for representing sounds in a score; for example, inventing a graphic score to represent sounds of the environment or using a combination of staff notation and invented symbols; then using the score when rehearsing and making changes to ensure that it is accurate and useful/easy to follow in performance

### Creating and making {#creating-and-making}

##### AC9AMU4C01 {#ac9amu4c01}

manipulate elements of music to communicate ideas, perspectives and/or meaning when composing and practising for performance

**Elaborations**
*  writing lyrics and/or melodies for songs, raps or chants and using formats such as graphic or staff notation or a lead-sheet or an audio recording to notate/document/record their work
*  using available technologies to create accompaniments; for example, improvising patterns (body percussion, classroom instruments) and recording as a loop or using digital tools to notate/document music; for example, using a template to create a lead-sheet or a story-boarding app to record information about where music will be used in a claymation they are creating in Media Arts
*  improvising phrases of music on an instrument to practise known notes and rhythm patterns or to extend the range of notes they can play on an instrument
*  learning songs and/or instrumental music associated with specific cultures, such as cultural groups in the local community or cultures from Asia, or cultures where a language they are learning is spoken
*  listening to live or recorded performances of music and gathering ideas they can use in their performance, such as the feel or mood of the song/music, how to interpret characteristic rhythmic patterns or how they might use body percussion or other movements in their performance
*  manipulating the elements of music, such as dynamics and tempo, to express different characters or dramatic action and emotions when composing music for a screen-based work or to accompany drama, such as a re-telling of a familiar children’s story
*  combining composed and improvised sections to create a complete work; for example, composing a melody and accompaniment to create a theme song and combining with improvised/soundscape sections to accompany a reading/narration of a story they have written
*  working in pairs or groups to create ostinatos or accompaniments; for example, using ukuleles or bucket drums and composing ostinatos or accompaniments for songs they are learning

### Presenting and performing {#presenting-and-performing}

##### AC9AMU4P01 {#ac9amu4p01}

sing and play music they have learnt and/or composed in informal settings

**Elaborations**
*  performing music such as unison songs, rounds and instrumental music arranged for small ensembles that feature melody and accompaniment parts, such as ostinato or drones
*  introducing performances by sharing information such as the intended purposes of their compositions with others, and documenting how they used the elements of music when composing and/or performing
*  rehearsing and performing music using a range of technologies; for example, learning and (with assistance) applying techniques for using sound reinforcement equipment such as PA, microphones and speakers efficiently to ensure that the audience can hear their performance and they can hear other performers (foldback) or making recordings of rehearsals, listening and evaluating how well they are achieving their aims and making adjustments (as required)
*  planning how they will stage a performance and introduce their performances to audiences using spoken, written or audio-visual formats
*  reading from notation and/or documentation such as a lead-sheet (lyrics and chords), staff or graphic notation that includes invented or learnt symbols when practising and performing music
