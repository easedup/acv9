# Music - Years 7 and 8 {#music-years-7-and-8}

## Level Description {#level-description}

In this band, learning in Music builds on each student’s prior learning and experiences. Students learn in and through the music practices of listening, composing and performing. They use their music knowledge and skills in purposeful and creative ways, and continue to develop their connection with and contribution to the world as composers and performers and as audiences. They work individually and in collaboration with peers and teachers.

Students explore music in local, regional, national and global contexts such as music used in multi-arts, trans-disciplinary or hybrid forms, or music from countries or regions of Asia. They take opportunities to engage with living composers and performers, and expand their awareness of the diversity of music practices, genres and/or styles.

In this band, the focus is on students:

1.  exploring and responding to

*   music and music practices across cultures, times, places and/or other contexts; for example, through listening and evaluating their own music practices or analysing performances and compositions created or presented by others
*   the diversity of music created by First Nations Australians and how this work demonstrates respect for Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property rights

3.  developing practices and skills

*   creative practices and skills for listening (including aural skills), vocal and instrumental performance, and composition in music genres and/or styles of interest, interpreting and manipulating the elements of music: duration/time (including beat and rhythm, tempo, pulse, simple/compound metre), pitch, dynamics and expression, form and structure, timbre and texture
*   critical practices for reflecting, analysing, evaluating and responding to their own work and the work of others; for example, considering how to apply knowledge of music styles or structures in compositions, developing interpretations of music composed by others or evaluating their own performances

5.  composing in forms and genres such as songwriting, solo and/or ensemble instrumental music, music production, arranging or re-imagining, and developing interpretations of solo and/or ensemble music works for performance, using aural skills and/or available digital tools as appropriate
6.  presenting performances of music to audiences; for example, a specific target audience.

### Exploring and responding {#exploring-and-responding}

##### AC9AMU8E01 {#ac9amu8e01}

investigate the ways that composers and/or performers use the elements of music and/or compositional devices in music composed across cultures, times, places and/or other contexts

**Elaborations**
*  accessing and researching music through live or recorded/streamed performances to analyse performers’ interpretations of composers’ intentions; for example, using recordings and score/s or chart/s or other information such as an interview or review to identify how performers have interpreted a composer’s intentions, such as tempo choices, instrumentation, feel or articulation
*  listening to live or recorded music and identifying stylistic characteristics; for example, analysing how elements of music are manipulated and how compositional devices are used; then using this information to describe features of a style or to inform their performance of music in that style
*  listening to and evaluating how elements of music are manipulated in music composed by a range of composers, with the intention of drawing attention to social issues or values; for example, protest songs, nationalistic music, music that uses “folk”/traditional tunes in re-imagined ways, songs with lyrics that focus on themes such as identity or belonging
*  researching and discussing the influence of social, cultural and historical developments relating to specific styles, forms or traditions and incorporating these into their performance and/or compositions; for example, conventions relating to forms such as 32-bar song form, genres such as chamber music, or traditions such as singer-songwriter

##### AC9AMU8E02 {#ac9amu8e02}

investigate the diversity of music composed and/or performed by First Nations Australians, considering culturally responsive approaches to Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property rights

**Elaborations**
*  exploring ways that First Nations Australian composers and/or performers communicate their ideas and messages across communities and cultures; for example, by asking questions such as “What are the impacts of this musician’s/these musicians’ music?” and “What music styles or genres is this musician drawing on in creating their own music?”
*  investigating when, how and why copyright and/or Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property rights might be relevant to their practice as, for example, listeners, songwriters, composers and/or performers
*  exploring how protocols for protecting Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property rights exist to help students make ethical choices about how they use music, as listeners or creators; for example, by asking questions such as, “Who wrote this music?”, “May I use ideas from this song, and do I need permission to do so?”
*  investigating issues relating to the use of First Nations Australian languages or stories in lyrics and songs or music for screen-based works; for example, considering case studies that illustrate protocols relating to Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property rights

### Developing practices and skills {#developing-practices-and-skills}

##### AC9AMU8D01 {#ac9amu8d01}

develop and practise listening/aural skills and vocal and/or instrumental skills/techniques for manipulating elements of music to achieve expressive effects

**Elaborations**
*  experimenting with ways in which vocal/instrumental techniques can be used to manipulate elements of music to achieve intended effects, such as an expressive sound that is typical of a particular style, and transcribing or documenting their ideas as a reference for future performances or composition
*  practising technical and expressive skills such as intonation, pitch/rhythmic accuracy, phrasing or shaping dynamics and articulation to communicate expressive intent using voices and/or instruments
*  developing techniques for extending/varying patterns such as harmonic, rhythmic or melodic patterns; for example, identifying qualities of chords in isolation and experimenting with different ways to order the chords to create a chord progression and improvising over the progression, or using the chord progression in a song or instrumental music
*  experimenting with ways in which digital tools can be used when arranging musical ideas or creating effects; for example, using digitally produced parts alone or in combination with voice/vocalisation or other instruments
*  developing ability to manipulate and control elements of music to enhance performance and communicate intentions; for example, recording alternative approaches to interpreting a phrase or melody and evaluating it to identify preferred options
*  using a listening diary/journal format to document ideas for compositions, interpretations, re-imaginings or performances
*  writing/notating a chart or lead-sheet to record ideas from a songwriting workshop or using software to write additional parts such as a bassline to accompany a melody

##### AC9AMU8D02 {#ac9amu8d02}

reflect on their own and others’ music to inform choices they make as composers and performers about how they will manipulate elements of music and/or compositional devices

**Elaborations**
*  practising, using aural skills and music terminology, how to identify and describe technical and expressive elements of music, such as chord progressions or the way a performer interprets, performs or shapes melodies, phrasing or dynamics; for example, when songwriting, in an instrumental music lesson or in a discussion with peers or a teacher
*  practising ways to use aural/visual cues when playing or singing in an ensemble; for example, chords or phrases that indicate place within a structure (aural) or gestures indicating tempo or entries (visual)
*  using focused listening and selected aural skills to evaluate the use of elements of music when listening to a recording for the purpose of making decisions about how they will interpret the music

### Creating and making {#creating-and-making}

##### AC9AMU8C01 {#ac9amu8c01}

interpret music in a variety of forms and/or styles, manipulating elements of music and employing relevant vocal/instrumental techniques

**Elaborations**
*  investigating and trialling ways of realising stylistic features when rehearsing; for example, using effects such as distortion, decay or delay, or using accent/stress to achieve a stylistic feel when interpreting melodies or rhythmic patterns
*  interpreting music that is notated/documented in a range of formats, such as graphic or interactive scores, staff notation or tablature (TAB) and recordings; for example, using a recording and a chart that includes melody, form and harmony/chords to develop an arrangement of a song
*  using student and teacher set goals as a focus for practising and rehearsing a range of solo and/or ensemble music
*  manipulating sound quality by applying understanding of the range of sounds/timbres that different instruments and voice types can produce; for example, manipulating dynamics and timbre in voice or acoustic or digital instruments to create a specific effect
