# Music - Years 1 and 2 {#music-years-1-and-2}

## Level Description {#level-description}

In this band, learning in The Arts builds on each student’s prior learning and experiences. Students continue to learn through purposeful and creative play in structured learning programs designed to foster a strong sense of wellbeing and develop their connection with and contribution to the world. They work individually and in collaboration with peers and teachers drawing on their imagination, works of fiction, real-life experiences and learnings from across the curriculum to support their engagement in Arts learning as artists and as audiences.

Students explore music that they experience at home, school or through family and community events. They connect with composers and/or performers who live and work in the community; for example, by experiencing live and/or virtual performances. They use stimulus materials such as images, events, texts, questions and/or observations as inspiration for their own composing and performing. These experiences support students to develop aesthetic knowledge across cognitive, sensory, emotive and physical domains, and to value arts works and practices from across cultures, communities and/or other contexts.

In this band, the focus is on students:

1.  exploring and responding to

*   music across cultures, communities and/or other contexts through listening and performing; for example, singing songs or moving to music
*   examples of music composed and/or performed by First Nations Australians

3.  developing creative and critical practices and skills

*   creative practices for composing and performing such as skills for listening, singing and playing instruments, and, as appropriate, using notation; for example, graphic notation
*   critical practices by observing, reflecting on and responding to music they experience (including music they compose and/or perform)

5.  composing, singing and playing instruments, using the elements of music such as duration/time (beat and rhythm, tempo), pitch, dynamics and expression, texture and/or timbre
6.  performing/sharing music they have learnt and/or composed in informal settings such as classroom presentations.

## Strands {#strands}

### Exploring and responding {#exploring-and-responding}

##### AC9AMU2E01 {#ac9amu2e01}

explore where, why and how people across cultures, communities and/or other contexts experience music

**Elaborations**
*  listening to and talking about music that features instruments and/or voices/vocalisations from diverse contexts and cultures, and sharing observations about the music, such as identifying the instruments used or identifying the purpose the music was composed for; identifying and learning songs for special occasions (for example, birthday songs) or exploring how music is used to enhance the action or mood in a game they play on a digital device or a cartoon they watch (for example, “How is the music telling me that everyone is happy or that the rainforest is sad?”)
*  exploring ways that people in their local community are making and experiencing music; for example, identifying ways of being a musician such as singer, songwriter, composer, instrumentalist, sound engineer or digital music producer; being a listener or audience member (at home, in places designed especially for music performance and/or in physical or virtual public spaces); making a class list of places where they experience music each day and noting who the performers/composers are and their responses to the music (for example, responding to questions such as, “Which music makes you want to sing along?”, “Why don’t we know who composed this music?” and “Does that matter?”)
*  identifying opportunities for engaging with music in their daily life by being a composer, performer or audience; for example, singing when no-one else can hear you, singing in a group, writing and recording songs using available digital devices and apps, listening to music, improvising chants/raps to make everyday tasks more interesting, noticing how music is used in screen-based products such as games, cartoons or e-books
*  discussing where, how and why they and their peers or family members experience music, and their music preferences; for example, compiling a playlist that combines their favourite music from the different generations in a family or creating a school playlist
*  practising active listening skills; for example, moving with the beat and clapping rhythmic ideas or being aware of pitch and volume when they are singing/vocalising and/or playing instruments

##### AC9AMU2E02 {#ac9amu2e02}

explore examples of music composed and/or performed by First Nations Australians

**Elaborations**
*  identifying where and how they can experience music composed and/or performed by First Nations Australians, such as via mainstream music platforms (live performance, video, television, radio, streaming), music for ceremonies at their school, in their community, or as part of state and national events
*  exploring the diverse music styles represented in music composed and performed by First Nations Australians; for example, listening to music that is available through mainstream media; music performed at a local festival, by street performers, by choirs and/or orchestras; or music created or performed for events such as openings of cultural or community events or as part of a Welcome to Country, and asking questions such as “What instruments and voices can I hear?”, “How is this music communicating message/s about Country/Place?” or focusing exclusively on the music (the sound): “How is this music similar or different to other music I listen to?”
*  exploring how the elements of music are used to create specific effects in screen-based or theatrical works that communicate First Nations Australian cultural knowledge; for example, viewing cartoons or animations that retell traditional stories and using Viewpoints to ask questions such as “How is texture being used to create tension in this part of the story?”, “How is melody being used to represent characters in this story?”, “How are tempo and dynamics being used to communicate the mood or feeling?”

### Developing practices and skills {#developing-practices-and-skills}

##### AC9AMU2D01 {#ac9amu2d01}

develop listening skills and skills for singing and playing instruments

**Elaborations**
*  experimenting with their speaking and singing voices/vocalisation to create a range of expressive effects; for example, varying dynamics or exploring different ways of sliding, scooping or bending, snapping, blending or creating a mood or atmosphere
*  playing music games or taking part in skill-development activities to develop skills for listening, composing and performing; for example, movement/body percussion games that develop skills relating to pulse, beat and rhythm
*  improvising on pitch and rhythm patterns to develop skills relevant to different elements of music; for example, echo clapping, calling and response singing
*  participating in singing games/activities that involve pitch awareness or matching pitch; listening to features of music such as dynamics or articulation and replicating or varying what they hear; playing games that involve repeating or extending a given idea such as a melodic or rhythmic pattern
*  developing listening skills for specific purposes, such as listening to count-ins, to become confident about tempo; being quiet when listening to live music (and learning when applause or comment is expected during a performance); listening to ensure their voice/vocalisation/part is blended with other voices/being projected at about the same dynamic level when singing or playing in a group
*  exploring and improvising ways to create and vary sounds using a range of sound sources, such as voice/vocalisation, classroom instruments, found/environmental/repurposed objects (buckets, leaves, etc.) or digital instruments; for example, exploring how they can vary sounds using elements of music such as dynamics, articulation or tone colour, the effects they can create by combining voices and instruments or combining sounds and silences, and asking questions such as, “Which way of playing/singing sounds best?”, “What is the way I want it to sound?”
*  developing understanding of what matching pitch means; for example, by using a digital tuner or closing eyes and gradually adjusting to match a partner’s pitch
*  practising techniques for singing songs and playing classroom instruments

### Creating and making {#creating-and-making}

##### AC9AMU2C01 {#ac9amu2c01}

select and combine elements of music when composing and practising music for performance

**Elaborations**
*  contributing to decisions about how to interpret the elements of music, such as tempo (duration/time), dynamics and/or articulation when performing songs, chants, rhymes or instrumental music
*  improvising and making decisions about how to combine sounds to create compositions; for example, combining pitch and rhythm patterns, improvising melodies and drone accompaniments, making decisions about instrumentation, articulation, texture and dynamics
*  using voices and body percussion to create music that features contrasting examples of elements of music, such as sound/silence, fast/slow, long/short, high/low, loud/soft
*  improvising patterns of body movement, such as clapping or stamping, to create  accompaniments; for example, accompaniments for songs
*  practising a repertoire of songs, chants and rhymes focusing on using elements of music such as tempo, dynamics or articulation to create expressive effects
*  using signs and symbols to notate or document patterns or soundscapes and/or using an available device to record work in progress so that they can listen and make decisions about what to do next
*  practising music using accessible technologies; for example, using recordings to make decisions about dynamics or tempo
*  writing lyrics for a chant/rap and improvising to develop rhythmic patterns they can use to perform the lyrics; for example, combining unison sections (voices alone) with multi-part sections (voices and body percussion or instruments)

### Presenting and performing {#presenting-and-performing}

##### AC9AMU2P01 {#ac9amu2p01}

sing and play music in informal settings

**Elaborations**
*  singing songs, performing chants/raps or playing instrumental music they have learnt or composed for an audience of peers and teachers
*  following agreed decisions about how the music should sound; for example, using singing voice rather than speaking voice, holding beaters or instruments in ways that produce clear and clean sound, performing at the agreed tempo
*  making decisions about how/where to sit/stand in a performance space; for example, deciding if they can see cues/signals from other performers or a conductor more easily if they are standing in curved or straight rows, or whether they can perform an instrumental part more accurately/comfortably when standing or sitting
*  introducing a performance by writing text for a slide that shares information about the music with the audience; for example, the title of the music, the name of the composer and identifying where, when or why it was composed, and then projecting the slide before or during the performance
*  listening intentionally and respectfully during performances and when invited, participating in the performance by using body percussion (clapping, tapping, stamping) or singing
*  contributing to post-performance discussions; for example, sharing ideas about what the best part of the performance was or asking the performers questions such as, “How long have you been singing/playing as a group?” or “How did you get your instrument to …?”
