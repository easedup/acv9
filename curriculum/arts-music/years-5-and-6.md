# The Arts - Music - Years 5 and 6

## Level Description

In this band, students continue to learn in and through the practices of The Arts subjects, building on their prior learning and experiences. They work creatively and purposefully, and continue to develop their connection with and contribution to the world as artists and as audiences. They work individually and in collaboration with peers and teachers.

Students engage with music, composers and/or performers across cultures, times, places and/or other contexts; for example, exploring music in their local area, state/territory or a country or region of Asia. They take opportunities to engage with living composers and performers and their music; for example, by experiencing live or recorded/streamed performances. They continue to use stimulus materials such as images, events, texts, questions and/or observations as inspiration for their own composing and performing. These experiences support students to develop aesthetic knowledge across cognitive, sensory, emotive and physical domains, and to value arts works and practices from diverse cultures.

In this band, the focus is on students:

1.  exploring and responding to

*   music from local, regional, national and global cultures and contexts that shows ways the elements of music can be used to communicate ideas; for example, by listening to and/or learning songs or instrumental pieces
*   music that showcases ways First Nations Australians are continuing and revitalising cultures

3.  developing creative and critical practices and skills

*   creative practices for composing and performing such as skills for listening, singing and playing instruments, and, as appropriate, using notation; for example, graphic or staff notation and/or lead-sheets
*   critical practices such as using aural skills, reflecting on and responding to music they experience, including music they compose and perform

5.  composing and practising music for performance, manipulating the elements of music such as duration/time (including beat and rhythm, tempo, pulse, metre), pitch, dynamics and expression, texture, articulation (accent) and/or timbre to compose music; for example, songwriting, arranging a known melody or composing for an instrument they are learning, singing and playing instruments, and using aural skills to support these processes
6.  performing music they have learnt and/or composed in informal and/or formal settings, such as spaces within the school including as appropriate, school-hosted digital spaces such as a school learning management system.

## Strands

### Exploring and responding

##### AC9AMU6E01

explore ways that the elements of music are combined in music across cultures, times, places and/or other contexts

**Elaborations**
*  listening to music that uses a range of instrumentation or forms (song forms, theme and variations, binary) and describing how the elements of music are used or combined; for example, identifying which instruments are playing the melody and which are playing accompanying parts, or exploring the effect of changing instruments by comparing original versions with arrangements/covers/reimagined versions
*  evaluating and discussing (using their own words and learnt music terminology) personal preferences for music from a range of contexts and cultures, such as music they listen to for leisure/pleasure, music they play in an ensemble, music that is important to their family or community, music they listen to for inspiration for their own compositions or performances, or music in specific genres such as music for screen-based contexts such as games or videos
*  identifying and describing features of music that create effects, such as ways in which elements of music are manipulated (using rhythm, melody, articulation, dynamics or instrumentation) or use of compositional devices/structural features such as riffs or use of specific instrumental techniques; for example, strumming patterns
*  listening to (and/or performing) and responding to music from a variety of contexts and cultures, such as Asian cultures; for example, discussing what they like about the music and why they think the composer/performer chose to write/perform the music, using their own words and learnt music terminology, and giving reasons for their opinions
*  considering ways in which music is used in celebrations, ceremonies or rituals; for example, at their school or in their local community, and exploring ways the music is used to give structure to the occasion or to communicate themes such as identity or belonging
*  demonstrating understanding of the form and structure of popular songs; for example, using parody to demonstrate the different structures used within popular song, discussing different processes for writing lyrics that tell a story, collaboratively generating ideas to create new lyrics to known music, rehearsing the re-imagined song (using aural, technical and expressive skills) and performing their song parody to their peers

##### AC9AMU6E02

explore ways First Nations Australians use music to continue and revitalise culture

**Elaborations**
*  investigating the range of music styles and instruments that living First Nations Australian composers and/or performers are using in their work
*  investigating how music is being used to maintain and revitalise knowledge and use of First Nations Australian languages
*  investigating music that First Nations Australian composers are creating for dance, drama, media arts or visual arts works that share cultural knowledge; for example, music for animations that share cultural knowledge about places, birds or animals
*  investigating how First Nations Australian composers and/or performers share knowledge about their culture as part of performances; for example, acknowledging Country/Place before a performance, or sharing information about the language they are using in their song/performance or their inspiration for composing a song or instrumental work

### Developing practices and skills

##### AC9AMU6D01

develop listening/aural skills and skills for manipulating elements of music to achieve expressive effects when composing, singing and playing instruments

**Elaborations**
*  developing vocal and/or instrumental skills by focusing on specific elements of music; for example, improvising patterns, phrases or melodies, such as harmonic, rhythmic or melodic patterns, and describing different ways they are using rhythm, melody and structure in their improvisations
*  combining listening/aural and performance skills; for example, listening to hear other parts when singing or playing in a group and adjusting own volume to achieve a balanced sound
*  exploring vocal/instrumental techniques they can use to manipulate elements of music to create contrast, repetition and balance in their compositions (for example, when composing instrumental parts for a song or creating bass and harmony parts to add texture to a melody they have composed), using focused listening and aural skills to evaluate the effects they are creating, practising and refining techniques required to achieve accuracy and making decisions about how to refine their ideas to accommodate their level of technical skill
*  developing vocal and instrumental skills such as manipulating the timbre of instruments and voices/vocalisation to create and vary mood or atmosphere, or techniques that will extend their range, fluency, control or accuracy; for example, using observations from listening and questions based on Viewpoints to set goals, track progress or explore areas of interest (“How did that performer get that sound?” or “I think that this song is about …, how can I share my feeling with the audience”?)
*  using digital tools to build skills such as accuracy and control; for example, using a digital tuner, using software to monitor articulation or dynamic range, or a digital metronome to monitor tempo
*  practising techniques for singing and playing to develop technical skills in solo and ensemble music; for example, to accurately interpret rhythm and pitch

### Creating and making

##### AC9AMU6C01

manipulate elements of music and use compositional devices to communicate ideas, perspectives and/or meaning when composing and practising music for performance, and notate, document and/or record the music they compose

**Elaborations**
*  working collaboratively to compose music in response to an image, theme or question; for example, writing lyrics and using acoustic instruments and/or digital tools to create melodies, a chord progression, bassline or other parts for a song that they will use in a presentation of learning in a subject such as History or English
*  improvising and experimenting with combinations of sounds and/or using digital tools to create moods and atmospheres, or organising, developing and refining ideas by experimenting with elements such as texture, tone colour or structure to achieve intended effects
*  rehearsing a range of unison and part music individually and/or in an ensemble, using listening skills and questions based on Viewpoints to assist decision-making about how specific elements of music will be interpreted and using listening skills to refine their work (“How did the composer intend this melody to sound?” or “How can I incorporate a sense of the energy in the original performance of this song when my band doesn’t have all the instruments?”)
*  using a limited range of pitches to compose melodies for a selected instrument such as one they are learning to play; for example, a pitch range that only uses notes they can play, and using digital tools to add other parts
*  arranging or re-imagining a known work; for example, writing new lyrics and arranging for available instruments
*  composing a melody, manipulating elements of music such as rhythm, pitch, dynamics, texture or timbre, and using a compositional device/s such as a given form (verse/chorus, binary or ternary), contrast or repetition to structure the music, notating, documenting and/or recording; for example, using a combination of graphic and staff notation or making an audio recording
*  using voice/vocalisation and sounds such as body percussion or drumming; for example, developing a song, chant or soundscape to accompany a Welcome to Country (for example, First Nations Australian students working with an Elder or a group of people who have permission to develop this part of a ceremony) or an Acknowledgement of Country (using correct protocols)
*  using digital tools, voices and instruments to compose, notate, document music and/or record music; for example, combining loops constructed from melodic and/or rhythmic patterns with live performance, using voices and instruments or using notation software to create a score for performance by voice and instruments

### Presenting and performing

##### AC9AMU6P01

perform music in a range of forms they have learnt and/or composed in informal and/or formal settings

**Elaborations**
*  rehearsing and refining performances to engage audiences and communicate ideas, perspectives and/or meaning; for example, focusing on expressive elements of music such as dynamics and balance when rehearsing performances of songs from a cultural group in their community or songs in a language they are learning
*  providing and responding to feedback to refine performances and compositions; for example, discussing how the composer indicates dynamics in the music and how the performer/s interpret this information and how the performer/s communicate the mood of the music; for example, using tone colour/timbre and/or articulation (phrasing, staccato, legato)
*  presenting performances via digital platforms including, if age-appropriate, interacting with audiences via platforms such as school intranet or website, and considering online safety protocols; for example, streaming or uploading recordings of performances and posing questions for the audience to respond to in a chat space

## Achievement Standards

By the end of Year 6, students explain how elements of music are manipulated in music they compose, perform and/or experience. They describe how music composed and/or performed across contexts, cultures, times and/or places communicates ideas, perspectives and/or meanings. They describe how music is used to continue and/or revitalise cultures.

Students demonstrate listening and aural skills when composing and performing. They use elements of music and compositional devices to compose music that communicates ideas. They notate, document and/or record the music. They perform music in formal and/or informal settings.
