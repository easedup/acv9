# Humanities and Social Sciences - Geography 7-10 - Year 9

## Level Description

The Year 9 curriculum involves the study of 2 sub-strands.

**Biomes and food security** – focuses on the biomes of the world, their characteristics and significance as a source of food and fibre. Students examine the distribution of biomes as regions, and their contribution to food production and food security. They consider the effects of the alteration of biomes, and the environmental challenges and constraints of expanding sustainable food production in the future.

It is suggested that the study of this topic draws on studies from Australia and countries in Asia.

**Geographies of interconnections** – focuses on how people, through their choices and actions, are connected to places throughout the world in a wide variety of ways, and how these connections help to make and change places and their environments. Students examine the nature of these connections between people and places through the products people buy and the effects of their production on the places that make them. Students consider the management of the impacts of tourism and trade on places.

It is suggested that the study of this topic draws on studies from Australia and other countries.

Inquiry questions provide a framework for developing students’ knowledge, understanding and skills. The following inquiry questions are examples only and may be used or adapted to suit local contexts.

*   What are the causes and consequences of change in places and environments, and how can this change be managed?
*   What are the future implications of changes to places and environments?
*   Why are interconnections and interdependencies important for the future of places and environments?

##### AC9HG9K03

the environmental, economic and technological factors that impact agricultural productivity, in Australia and a country in Asia

**Elaborations**
*  examining how environmental factors, such as climate, soil, landform, water and hazards, support higher agricultural production, such as wheat, rice and maize, in Australia and a country in Asia
*  examining how economic factors such as available land, labour, finance and enterprise, and technological factors such as biotechnology and use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) software, affect agricultural production in Australia and a country in Asia; for example, increased labour supply or access to storage, transportation and markets
*  examining how agricultural innovations have reduced environmental limitations on food production in Australia and a country in Asia; for example, increased food production due to research into and development of high-yielding and genetically engineered pest resistant varieties, construction of drip irrigation systems, and the use of stubble mulching, intercropping, agroforestry and crop rotation
*  explaining the impact of the interconnections between environmental, economic and technological factors on the yield of a particular crop, such as wheat, rice or maize, in Australia

##### AC9HG9K04

challenges to sustainable food production and food security in Australia and appropriate management strategies

**Elaborations**
*  examining environmental impacts of changes to food production causing a decline in the capacity of the land to provide agricultural products; for example, land and water degradation such as soil erosion, salinity and desertification, shortage of fresh water, competing land uses, climate change and pollution contribute to a decrease in food production
*  examining economic and social impacts of changes to food production; for example, competing land uses such as urban and industrial uses, and recreation activities

*  examining management strategies that improve food security; for example, efforts to reduce food wastage, government policies or trade barriers
*  explaining management strategies that restore the quality or diversity of agriculture in Australia; for example, improving the function of natural biomes and anthropogenic biomes, monitoring land management practices, improving the condition of the soil or building the capability of farmers
*  generating ideas for a strategy to expand agricultural production in Australia; for example, market bush food such as herbs and wattle seed, invest in research, support farm innovations or develop the expertise of farmers

#### Geographies of interconnections

##### AC9HG9K05

the ways changing transportation and technologies are used to connect people to services, information and people in other places

*  discussing how communications infrastructure and networks support people to collaborate; for example, local people working for social sustainability and inclusion such as the Masai in Kenya, Berber in North Africa, San or Kalahari Bushmen in southern Africa, Uyghurs in China, Ainu in Japan, Inuit in Greenland and Yanomami in the Amazon Basin
*  interpreting differences in people’s access to the internet between and within countries, such as in rural areas across Australia and across the world, including a country of Asia, and explaining how technologies are used to connect people to information, services and other people
*  examining how technologies have made it possible for places to provide a range of global business services, such as businesses operating call centres in India and the Philippines

##### AC9HG9K06

the effects on places of people’s travel, recreational, cultural or leisure choices, and the strategies for managing the impacts on these places

**Elaborations**
*  examining the effects on people, places or environments of mining, farming, forestry or the production of manufactured goods
*  explaining the environmental effects of the production and distribution of consumer products and services on the places that produce the raw materials, the people who make the products, and the environments that receive the waste at the end of the products’ life; for example, the environmental effects of an e-waste supply chain from mining, production and sales to waste disposal

*  evaluating primary or secondary research materials for relevance (for example, “Does the information reflect current thinking on sustainable food production?”) and reliability (for example, “Who is/are the author/s? Does the author reference other experts or reports in the field of environmental management?”)
*  creating a presentation of data and information using geospatial technologies; for example, a 3D diagram illustrating interactions between an oil spill in coral reefs and resultant decline in aquatic food production; a flow diagram showing the daily activities of a female subsistence farmer in Africa; or a diagram of a mangrove ecosystem before and after human interactions

## Achievement Standards

By the end of Year 9, students explain how peoples’ activities or environmental processes change the characteristics of places. They explain the effects of human activity on environments, and the effects of environments on human activity. They explain the features of biomes’ distribution and identify implications for environments. They analyse the interconnections between people and places and environments. They identify and explain how these interconnections influence people, and change places and environments. Students analyse strategies to address a geographical phenomenon or challenge using environmental, social or economic criteria.

 Students develop a range of questions about a geographical phenomenon or challenge. They collect, represent and compare relevant and reliable geographical data and information by using a range of primary research methods and secondary research materials in a range of formats. They interpret and analyse data and information to explain patterns and trends and infer relationships. They draw evidence-based conclusions about the impact of the geographical phenomenon or challenge. They develop and evaluate strategies, predict impacts and make a recommendation. Students use geographical knowledge, concepts, terms and digital tools as appropriate to develop descriptions, explanations and responses that acknowledge research findings.
