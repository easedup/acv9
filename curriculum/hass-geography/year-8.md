# Humanities and Social Sciences - Geography 7-10 - Year 8

## Level Description

The Year 8 curriculum involves the study of 2 sub-strands.

**Landforms and landscapes** – focuses on the processes that shape individual landforms, the values and meanings placed on landforms and landscapes by diverse cultures, and hazards associated with landscapes. Students explore the distribution of Australia’s distinctive landscapes and significant landforms. They also consider the ways that the sustainability of significant landscapes and the impacts of hazards are managed.

It is suggested that the study of this topic draws on studies from Australia and countries in Asia.

**Changing nations** – focuses on the changing human geography of countries with the process of urbanisation, the reasons for the high level of urban concentration in Australia, and the influences of internal and international migration. Students can examine the distribution of population in Australia compared to other countries and shifts in population distribution over time. They also focus on the ways that sustainability of Australia’s urban areas is managed.

It is suggested that the study of this topic draws on studies from Australia, the United States of America and a country in Asia.

Inquiry questions provide a framework for developing students’ knowledge, understanding and skills. The following inquiry questions are examples only and may be used or adapted to suit local contexts.

*   How do environmental and human processes affect the characteristics of places and environments?
*   How do the interconnections between places, people and environments affect the lives of people?
*   What are the consequences of changes to places and environments, and how can these changes be managed?
