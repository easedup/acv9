# Science - Year 6 {#science-year-6}

## Level Description {#level-description}

In Year 6 students develop an understanding of interdependencies between systems as they explore the relationship between physical conditions of habitats and the growth and survival of living things and investigate the effect of the relative positions of Earth and the sun on phenomena such as day length. They identify and classify components in electrical circuits and learn to describe energy flows in terms of transfer and transformation. They are introduced to ways to classify changes to substances. Students begin to appreciate the role of controlling variables in fair testing and the value of accuracy in measurements. They generalise about relationships between events, phenomena and systems and use identified patterns, trends and relationships to develop scientific explanations and draw reasoned conclusions.

Inquiry questions can help excite students’ curiosity and challenge their thinking. Following are examples of inquiry questions that could be used to prompt discussion and exploration:

*   How would life be different if we couldn’t harness electrical energy?
*   What if Earth were not on a tilt?
*   Are you more likely to win a Nobel prize in science as a team or an individual?
*   Why is it important for a test to be ‘fair’?
*   How does the weather affect local habitats?
