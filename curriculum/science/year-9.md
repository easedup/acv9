# Science - Year 9 {#science-year-9}

## Level Description {#level-description}

In Year 9 students consider the operation of systems at a range of scales and how those systems respond to external changes in order to maintain stability. They explore ways in which the human body system responds to changes in the external environment through physiological feedback mechanisms and the reproductive processes that enable a species to respond to a changing environment over time. They are introduced to the notion of the atom as a system of protons, electrons and neutrons, and how this system can change through nuclear decay. They learn that matter can be rearranged through chemical change and that these changes play an important role in many systems. They are introduced to the concepts of conservation of matter and energy and begin to develop a more sophisticated view of energy transfer. They explore these concepts as they relate to the global carbon cycle. Students begin to consider how well a sample or model represents the phenomena under study and use a range of evidence to support their conclusions.

Inquiry questions can help excite students’ curiosity and challenge their thinking. Following are examples of inquiry questions that could be used to prompt discussion and exploration:

*   Why was the discovery of neutrons important?
*   How is scientific consensus established? What if it isn’t?
*   Could synthesised organs make organ donation obsolete?
*   How does the carbon cycle affect life on Earth?
*   How do different technologies help humans to communicate?
