# Science - Foundation Year {#science-foundation-year}

## Level Description {#level-description}

In Foundation, learning in Science builds on the Early Years Learning Framework and each student’s prior learning and experiences. Science encourages students to explore their environment and be curious about their surroundings.

Students build wonder and their natural curiosity by observing everyday objects, materials and living things and by exploring changes in the world around them, including changes they can effect, such as making things move or change shape. They learn that observations can be organised to make patterns and that these patterns can be used to make predictions about phenomena. They seek answers to questions they pose using their senses to gather different types of information. They understand that making observations and predictions is a core part of science.

Inquiry questions can help excite students’ curiosity and challenge their thinking. Following are examples of inquiry questions that could be used to prompt discussion and exploration:

*   Why do we have different senses? How do we use them?
*   Why is sorting important?
*   How are a spider and a fly alike and different?
*   Are wheels the only way to get around?
*   Why do people describe things differently?

explore the ways people make and use observations and questions to learn about the natural world

**Elaborations**
*  using their senses to make observations and exploring how scientists use their senses as well as equipment to make observations
*  viewing examples of observations such as rock paintings, bark drawings, age-appropriate written reports, labelled drawings or photographs to explore ways they can make and record observations
*  exploring how First Nations Australians gain knowledge about the land and its vital resources, such as water and food, through observation
*  interacting with stories or documentaries about scientists such as Dame Jane Goodall or Sir Joseph Banks and noticing the ways they make their observations such as through drawings, collections, sound recordings and photography and how they ask questions about what they think they will observe and find
*  watching an age-appropriate documentary; noticing how people including scientists, engineers, naturalists or citizen scientists ask questions; and posing their own questions

### Science inquiry {#science-inquiry}

#### Questioning and predicting {#questioning-and-predicting}

##### AC9SFI01 {#ac9sfi01}

pose questions and make predictions based on experiences

**Elaborations**
*  posing questions based on experiences, such as: ‘What part of a plant is broccoli?’ or ‘How high do balls bounce?’
*  posing questions about everyday objects and the materials that they may be made of
*  making predictions before field work, such as which plants and animals they may observe in the school grounds
*  making predictions about how an unusually shaped object such as an egg or a hexagonal block might move down a slope

#### Planning and conducting {#planning-and-conducting}

##### AC9SFI02 {#ac9sfi02}

engage in investigations safely and make observations using their senses

**Elaborations**
*  discussing ways to conduct investigations safely, such as by being sun safe, not running with equipment, not tasting objects or materials, and following teacher instructions
*  explaining safety considerations for using the senses of touch, smell, sight and hearing, and discussing why we do not use taste to make observations in science
*  using provided tools such as binoculars, magnifying glasses, digital photography or video to enhance their observations of plants and animals
*  recording observations using numbers, dots, drawings, voice recordings, digital photography or video

#### Processing, modelling and analysing {#processing-modelling-and-analysing}

*  identifying common features of familiar groups of animals, such as fish, birds or reptiles
*  identifying patterns of movement of objects, with guidance, such as that balls roll easily in a straight line when pushed, or toy cars move in certain ways because of their wheels
