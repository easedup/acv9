# Science - Year 10

## Level Description

In Year 10 students explore the biological, chemical, geological and astronomical evidence for different theories, such as the theory of natural selection and the big bang theory. Through investigating natural selection and processes of heredity they come to understand the evolutionary feedback mechanisms that ensure the continuity of life. They appreciate how energy drives the Earth system and how climate models simulate the flow of energy and matter within and between Earth’s spheres. Students develop a more sophisticated understanding of atomic theory to understand patterns and relationships within the periodic table. They understand that motion and forces are related by applying physical laws and can be modelled mathematically. Students analyse and synthesise data from systems at multiple scales to develop evidence-based explanations for phenomena. They learn that all models involve assumptions and approximations, and that this can limit the reliability of predictions based on those models.

Inquiry questions can help excite students’ curiosity and challenge their thinking. Following are examples of inquiry questions that could be used to prompt discussion and exploration:

*   Why is the periodic table such a big deal?
*   How do we know what is science and what is pseudoscience?
*   Why is accelerating climate change a threat to biodiversity?
*   Just because we can, should we?
*   How have advanced computing and big data changed science?
