# Science - Year 5 {#science-year-5}

## Level Description {#level-description}

In Year 5 students continue to explore the relationship between form and function by investigating how features of living things enable them to survive in their habitat. They identify stable and dynamic aspects of systems and appreciate that current systems, such as Earth’s surface, have characteristics that have resulted from past changes. They recognise that models are useful for investigating relationships between system components and can be used to predict the effects of changes. They explore observable phenomena associated with light and analyse patterns to identify that these phenomena have sets of characteristic behaviours. They begin to explain how matter structures the world around them. They develop explanations for the patterns they observe and recognise the importance of reflecting on their methods to identify potential sources of error before drawing conclusions.

Inquiry questions can help excite students’ curiosity and challenge their thinking. Following are examples of inquiry questions that could be used to prompt discussion and exploration:

*   Why has the Australian coastline changed over time?
*   Is an empty glass really empty?
*   Why does my shadow change?
*   How has science shaped our community?
*   What if emus could fly?
