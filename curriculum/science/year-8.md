# Science - Year 8 {#science-year-8}

## Level Description {#level-description}

In Year 8 students are introduced to cells as microscopic structures that explain macroscopic features of living systems. They connect form and function at an organ level and explore the organisation of a body system in terms of flows of matter between interdependent organs. They continue to develop a view of Earth as a dynamic system, in which change occurs across a range of timescales. They classify different types of energy and describe the role of energy in causing change in systems, including the role of energy and forces in the geosphere. They learn to classify matter at the atomic level and distinguish between chemical and physical change. They understand that chemical reactions also involve energy. Students use experimentation to isolate relationships between components in systems and explain these relationships through increasingly complex representations. They consider the magnitude of properties and events and use appropriate units to describe proportional relationships.

Inquiry questions can help excite students’ curiosity and challenge their thinking. Following are examples of inquiry questions that could be used to prompt discussion and exploration:

*   Can we predict changes to the shape and position of continents?
*   Are facts enough? How much does science communication matter?
*   How can we tell if a substance has changed?
*   How can we best measure what we cannot directly see?
*   How is a leaf like a lung?
