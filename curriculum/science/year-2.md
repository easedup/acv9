# Science - Year 2

## Level Description

In Year 2 students build on their experiences of the natural and physical world to identify the components of simple systems. They appreciate that Earth is a planet in space and identify other celestial objects. They explore the ways components in a system interact, such as by using their bodies or combining and manipulating objects to make sounds. They build on their understanding of properties of materials to recognise that those properties stay the same when the material is changed physically. They continue to build their understanding of patterns by observing that some patterns, such as the changing positions of the sun, moon and stars, can only be observed over certain timescales. As they explore patterns and relationships, they use counting and informal measurements to make and compare observations and recognise that organising these observations in tables makes it easier to identify and represent patterns. They appreciate that science involves making and organising observations to identify patterns and relationships, and that these patterns and relationships are the basis of scientific predictions.

Inquiry questions can help excite students’ curiosity and challenge their thinking. Following are examples of inquiry questions that could be used to prompt discussion and exploration:

*   Who does science?
*   How do we know Earth is round?
*   How can we make and sense music?
*   What’s the best material? Why?
*   How does the sky change over time?

*  listening to music and learning from musicians about how music can be understood as patterns of sounds and how they use their body or instruments to create music
*  discussing how we manage sound at home to ensure that we do not disturb each other or our neighbours, such as quietly closing doors, turning down the volume, taking off shoes on wooden floors or using headphones
