# Science - Year 7 {#science-year-7}

## Level Description {#level-description}

In Year 7 students explore the diversity of life on Earth and continue to develop their understanding of the role of classification in ordering and organising information. They use and develop models to represent and analyse the flow of energy and matter through ecosystems and explore the impact of changing components within these systems. They investigate relationships in the Earth-sun-moon system and use models to predict and explain events. They extend their understanding of the particulate nature of matter and explore how interactions of matter and energy at the sub-microscopic scale determine macroscopic properties. They consider the effects of multiple forces when explaining changes in an object’s motion. Students make accurate measurements and analyse relationships between system components. They construct and use models to test hypotheses about phenomena at scales that are difficult to study directly and use these observations and other evidence to draw conclusions. They begin to understand the relationship between science and society and appreciate the need for ethical and cultural considerations when acquiring data.

Inquiry questions can help excite students’ curiosity and challenge their thinking. Following are examples of inquiry questions that could be used to prompt discussion and exploration:

*   Mosquitoes are so annoying! What would the impact be if we got rid of them?
*   What would Australian ecosystems look like without fire?
*   How do simple machines make our lives easier?
*   Why is being able to separate mixtures important?
*   How have systems of classification changed over time? How do they differ across cultures?
