# English - Year 9 {#english-year-9}

## Level Description {#level-description}

The English curriculum is built around the 3 interrelated strands of _Language, Literature_ and _Literacy_. Together, the 3 strands focus on developing students’ knowledge, understanding and skills in listening, reading, viewing, speaking, writing and creating. Learning in English is recursive and cumulative, building on concepts, skills and processes developed in earlier years.

In Year 9, students interact with others and experience learning in familiar and unfamiliar contexts, including local or global community and vocational contexts.

Students engage with a variety of texts for enjoyment. They analyse, interpret, evaluate, discuss, create and perform a wide range of texts. Texts may include various types of media texts including film, digital and online texts, novels, non-fiction, poetry, dramatic performances and multimodal texts. Themes and issues may involve levels of abstraction, higher order reasoning and intertextual references. Students are beginning to develop a critical understanding of how texts, language, and visual and audio features are influenced by context.

The range of literary texts for Foundation to Year 10 comprises the oral narrative traditions and literature of First Nations Australians, and classic and contemporary literature from wide-ranging Australian and world authors, including texts from and about Asia.

Literary texts that support and extend students in Year 9 as independent readers may be drawn from a range of genres. They may involve complex, challenging plot sequences and/or hybrid structures that may serve multiple purposes. These texts may explore themes of human experience and cultural significance, interpersonal relationships, and/or ethical and global dilemmas in real-world and fictional settings. They may represent a variety of perspectives. Informative texts may represent a synthesis of technical and abstract information (from credible or verifiable sources) about a wide range of specialised topics and concepts. Language features may include successive complex sentences with embedded clauses, a high proportion of unfamiliar and technical vocabulary, figurative and rhetorical language, and/or dense information supported by various types of images and graphics.

Year 9 students create a range of texts whose purposes may be aesthetic, imaginative, reflective, informative, persuasive, analytical and/or critical; for example, narratives, performances, reports, discussions, literary analyses, arguments, transformations of texts and reviews for a range of audiences.
