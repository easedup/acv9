# English - Year 5 {#english-year-5}

## Level Description {#level-description}

The English curriculum is built around the 3 interrelated strands of _Language, Literature_ and _Literacy_. Together, the 3 strands focus on developing students’ knowledge, understanding and skills in listening, reading, viewing, speaking, writing and creating. Learning in English is recursive and cumulative, building on concepts, skills and processes developed in earlier years.

In Year 5, students interact with audiences for different purposes.

Students engage with a variety of texts for enjoyment. They listen to, read, view and interpret spoken, written and multimodal texts. Texts may include film and digital texts, novels, poetry, non-fiction and dramatic performances. The features of these texts may be used by students as models for creating their own work.

The range of literary texts for Foundation to Year 10 comprises the oral narrative traditions and literature of First Nations Australians, and classic and contemporary literature from wide-ranging Australian and world authors, including texts from and about Asia.

Literary texts that support and extend students in Year 5 as independent readers may include complex sequences of events, elaborated events including flashbacks and shifts in time, and a range of characters. These texts may explore themes of interpersonal relationships and ethical dilemmas in real-world and imagined settings. Informative texts may supply technical information and/or content about a wide range of topics of interest as well as topics being studied in other areas of the curriculum. Text structures may include chapters, headings and subheadings, tables of contents, indexes and glossaries. Language features may include complex sentences, unfamiliar technical vocabulary, figurative language, and information presented in various types of images and graphics. Texts may reveal that the English language is dynamic and changes over time.

Year 5 students create a range of imaginative, informative and persuasive types of texts that may include narratives, procedures, performances, reports, reviews, poetry, arguments and explanations for particular purposes and audiences.

From Year 5 onwards, students continue to develop legible handwriting.

## Strands {#strands}

### Language {#language}

#### Language for interacting with others {#language-for-interacting-with-others}

##### AC9E5LA01 {#ac9e5la01}

understand that language is selected for social contexts and that it helps to signal social roles and relationships

**Elaborations**
*  using language that signals the roles of chairperson and the different speaker positions in a debate
*  identifying ways in which cultures differ in making and responding to common requests; for example, periods of silence, degrees of formality
*  identifying some cultural protocols and communication processes of First Nations Australians

##### AC9E5LA02 {#ac9e5la02}

understand how to move beyond making bare assertions by taking account of differing ideas or opinions and authoritative sources

**Elaborations**
*  recognising that a bare assertion (for example, “It's the best film this year.”) often needs to be tempered by: using the “impersonal it” to distance oneself (for example, “It could be said that it is the best film this year.”); recruiting anonymous support (for example, “It is generally agreed that it is the best film this year.”); indicating a general source of the opinion (for example, “Most critics agree that it is the best film this year.”); specifying the source of the opinion (for example, “Reviewers for The Reel Film stated that it is the best film this year.”) and reflecting on the effect of these different choices

#### Text structure and organisation {#text-structure-and-organisation}

##### AC9E5LA03 {#ac9e5la03}

describe how spoken, written and multimodal texts use language features and are typically organised into characteristic stages and phases, depending on purposes in texts

**Elaborations**
*  becoming familiar with the typical stages and language features of types of texts such as narrative, procedure, arguments, explanation, discussion and informative texts, and how they can be composed in written, digital and multimedia forms to achieve their purpose
*  recognising that paragraphs vary in their function and how they are organised in a text and between different types of texts; for example, the differences between paragraphs in a narrative, an argument and a procedure
*  describing the stages and phases, and purposes of narratives, historical recounts, procedural recounts, causal explanations, discussions of alternative positions on an issue, information reports, reviews and types of poems

##### AC9E5LA04 {#ac9e5la04}

understand how texts can be made cohesive by using the starting point of a sentence or paragraph to give prominence to the message and to guide the reader through the text

**Elaborations**
*  observing how writers use the beginning of a sentence to signal to the reader how the text is developing; for example, “Snakes are reptiles. They have scales and no legs. Many snakes are poisonous. However, in Australia they are protected.”
*  recognising that a sequence of clauses may use different tenses but remain connected through a topic; for example, “Snakes were a problem in Australia. However, urban sprawl is ruining their habitats and they are now a protected species.”
*  recognising that sentence openers signal what the sentence will be about, and the rest of the sentence typically elaborates on the sentence opener by providing new information

#### Language for expressing and developing ideas {#language-for-expressing-and-developing-ideas}

##### AC9E5LA05 {#ac9e5la05}

understand that the structure of a complex sentence includes a main clause and at least one dependent clause, and understand how writers can use this structure for effect

**Elaborations**
*  knowing that complex sentences make connections between ideas to provide a reason; for example, “He jumped up because the bell rang.”; state a purpose; for example, “She raced home to confront her brother.”; express a condition; for example, “It will break if you push it.”; make a concession; for example, “She finished her work even though she was feeling tired.”; link 2 ideas in terms of various time relations; for example, “Nero fiddled while Rome burned.”

##### AC9E5LA06 {#ac9e5la06}

understand how noun groups can be expanded in a variety of ways to provide a fuller description of a person, place, thing or idea

explain how the sequence of images in print, digital and film texts has an effect on meaning

**Elaborations**
*  interpreting narrative texts told through wordless picture books
*  identifying and comparing sequences of images revealed through different hyperlink choices
*  viewing a short film or segment from a film without sound and comparing interpretations after viewing with sound
*  recognising how the sequence of images in texts by First Nations Australian authors create meaning

##### AC9E5LA08 {#ac9e5la08}

understand how vocabulary is used to express greater precision of meaning, including through the use of specialist and technical terms, and explore the history of words

**Elaborations**
*  using precise words for naming; for example, instead of “mammal” or “whale”, using “humpback whale”
*  exploring Greek and Latin roots in commonly used words; for example, the Greek root word “tele” meaning distant in words such as “telephone” and “teleport”

##### AC9E5LA09 {#ac9e5la09}

use commas to indicate prepositional phrases, and apostrophes where there is multiple possession

**Elaborations**
*  learning that in Standard Australian English, regular plural nouns ending in “s” form the possessive by adding just the apostrophe; for example, “the students' classroom”
*  learning that in Standard Australian English for proper nouns, the regular possessive form is always possible but a variant form without the second “s” is sometimes found; for example, “James’s house” or “James’ house”
*  learning that when there is more than one owner, the apostrophe is usually used for the last owner in the list; for example, “the cat and kitten’s bowls”
*  using commas to signal a prepositional phrase; for example, “On Saturday, before it rained we went to the beach.”
