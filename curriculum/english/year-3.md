# English - Year 3

## Level Description

The English curriculum is built around the 3 interrelated strands of _Language, Literature_ and _Literacy_. Together, the 3 strands focus on developing students’ knowledge, understanding and skills in listening, reading, viewing, speaking, writing and creating. Learning in English is recursive and cumulative, building on concepts, skills and processes developed in earlier years.

In Year 3, students use spoken, written or visual communication to interact with familiar audiences for a purpose.

Students engage with a variety of texts for enjoyment. They listen to, read and view spoken, written and multimodal texts. Texts may include oral texts, picture books, various types of print and digital texts, chapter books, rhyming verse, poetry, non-fiction, film, multimodal texts, dramatic performances, and texts used by students as models for constructing their own work.

In Year 3, students engage with a range of texts that support and extend them as independent readers. Informative texts include content of increasing complexity and technicality about topics of interest and topics being studied in other areas of the curriculum. Literary texts may describe events that extend over several pages, unusual happenings within a framework of familiar experiences and may include images that extend meaning. These texts use language features including varied sentence structures, some unfamiliar vocabulary, a significant number of high-frequency words that can be decoded using phonic and morphemic knowledge, a variety of punctuation conventions, and illustrations and diagrams that support and extend the printed text.

The range of literary texts for Foundation to Year 10 comprises the oral narrative traditions and literature of First Nations Australians, and classic and contemporary literature from wide-ranging Australian and world authors, including texts from and about Asia.

Year 3 students create imaginative, informative and persuasive types of texts, which may include narratives, procedures, performances, reports, reviews, poetry and argument for particular purposes and audiences.

## Strands

##### AC9E3LA04

understand that paragraphs are a key organisational feature of the stages of written texts, grouping related information together
