# English - Year 6

## Level Description

The English curriculum is built around the 3 interrelated strands of _Language, Literature_ and _Literacy_. Together, the 3 strands focus on developing students’ knowledge, understanding and skills in listening, reading, viewing, speaking, writing and creating. Learning in English is recursive and cumulative, building on concepts, skills and processes developed in earlier years.

In Year 6, students interact with audiences for different purposes.

Students engage with a variety of texts for enjoyment. They listen to, read, view and interpret spoken, written and multimodal texts. Texts may include film and digital texts, novels, poetry, non-fiction and dramatic performances. The features of these texts may be used by students as models for creating their own work.

The range of literary texts for Foundation to Year 10 comprises the oral narrative traditions and literature of First Nations Australians, and classic and contemporary literature from wide-ranging Australian and world authors, including texts from and about Asia.

Literary texts that support and extend students in Year 6 as independent readers may include elaborated events including flashbacks and shifts in time, and a range of less predictable characters. These texts may support students’ understanding of authors’ styles. They may explore themes of interpersonal relationships and ethical dilemmas in real-world and imagined settings. Informative texts may include technical information and/or content about a wide range of topics of interest as well as topics being studied in other areas of the curriculum. Text structures may include chapters, headings and subheadings, tables of contents, indexes and glossaries. Language features include complex sentences, unfamiliar technical vocabulary, figurative and idiomatic language, and information presented in various types of images and graphics.

Year 6 students create a range of imaginative, informative and persuasive types of texts that may include narratives, procedures, performances, reports, reviews, poetry, expositions, explanations and discussions for particular purposes and audiences.

## Strands

**Elaborations**
*  identifying language choices that evoke emotion and judgements in direct and indirect ways, and how they are used to persuade different audiences to take a position and/or action
*  understanding when to share feelings and opinions; for example, in a personal recount, and when to remain more objective; for example, in a factual recount

*  examining a text to identify strategies such as exaggeration to create humour
*  recognising that texts are organised into stages such as an introduction and that introductions may be divided into phases; for example, the introduction stage of a narrative may begin with a phase that is a “hook” or a flashback
*  explaining the characteristic stages and phases in reviews, discussions of alternative positions or historical recounts and identifying any adaptations of typical structures or language features

##### AC9E6LA04

understand that cohesion can be created by the intentional use of repetition, and the use of word associations

**Elaborations**
*  noting how a general word is often used for a more specific word already mentioned (word association); for example, “Look at those apples. Granny Smiths are my favourite.”
*  recognising how cohesion can be developed through repeating key words or by using synonyms or antonyms

#### Language for expressing and developing ideas

##### AC9E6LA05

understand how embedded clauses can expand the variety of complex sentences to elaborate, extend and explain ideas

**Elaborations**
*  investigating how the choice of conjunctions enables the construction of complex sentences to extend, to elaborate on and to explain ideas; for example, “The town that was flooded suffered extensive damage.”
*  creating complex sentences with embedded clauses to expand noun groups; for example, “Hamish studied the rock samples that he had collected on the excursion.”

##### AC9E6LA06

understand how ideas can be expanded and sharpened through careful choice of verbs, elaborated tenses and a range of adverb groups

**Elaborations**
*  knowing that the simple present tense is typically used to talk about present states; for example, “He lives in Darwin.” or actions that happen regularly in the present; for example, “He watches television every night.” or that represent “timeless” happenings, in information reports; for example, “Bears hibernate in winter.”
*  knowing that there are various ways in English to refer to future time: using the auxiliary “will”; for example, “She will call you tomorrow.”, using the present tense; for example, “Tomorrow, I leave for Hobart.” and using adverbials of time; for example, “She arrives in the morning.”
*  using precise verbs; for example, “slice”, “dice”, “fillet” and “segment” rather than general words; for example, “cut”

##### AC9E6LA07

identify and explain how images, figures, tables, diagrams, maps and graphs contribute to meaning

**Elaborations**
*  observing how sequential events can be represented visually by a series of images, including comic strips, timelines, photo stories, procedure diagrams and flowcharts, life-cycle diagrams and the flow of images in picture books
*  observing how concepts, information and relationships can be represented visually through tables, maps, graphs and diagrams
*  understanding that images and maps may be sensitive for First Nations Australians and ensuring that a disclaimer is applied or judgement is used about cultural appropriateness and sensitivities

##### AC9E6LA08

identify authors’ use of vivid, emotive vocabulary, such as metaphors, similes, personification, idioms, imagery and hyperbole

**Elaborations**
*  exploring how figurative language; for example, metaphors, personification and idioms, can be used to create vivid and less predictable shades of meaning
*  identifying authors’ use of vivid and emotive vocabulary in persuasive texts; for example, the vocabulary used in reviews
*  discussing texts, using vocabulary to name text structure, literary devices and language features; for example, using words that name the literary device used in a poem

##### AC9E6LA09

understand how to use the comma for lists, to separate a dependent clause from an independent clause, and in dialogue

**Elaborations**
*  identifying different uses of commas such as commas and conjunctions between independent clauses in compound sentences

#### Examining literature

##### AC9E6LE03

identify and explain characteristics that define an author's individual style

**Elaborations**
*  exploring 2 or more texts by the same author, identifying similarities; for example, subject or theme, characterisation, text structure, plot development, tone, vocabulary, voice, favoured grammatical structures and visual techniques in picture books, and determining the qualities that characterise an author's style
*  focusing on a First Nations Australian author and identifying characteristic elements of their writing; for example, images, theme and language
*  comparing similarities and differences between texts, including those by the same author or illustrator, and identifying the characteristics that define an author’s style; for example, comparing illustrations in picture books by the same illustrator, noting characteristic features

##### AC9E6LE04
