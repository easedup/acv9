# Mathematics - Year 1 {#mathematics-year-1}

## Level Description {#level-description}

In Year 1, learning in Mathematics builds on each student’s prior learning and experiences. Students engage in a range of approaches to learning and doing mathematics that develop their understanding of and fluency with concepts, procedures and processes by making connections, reasoning, problem-solving and practice. Proficiency in mathematics enables students to respond to familiar and unfamiliar situations by employing mathematical strategies to make informed decisions and solve problems efficiently.

Students further develop proficiency and positive dispositions towards mathematics and its use as they:

*   use their curiosity and imagination to explore situations, recognise patterns in their environment and choose ways of representing their thinking when communicating with others
*   demonstrate that numbers can be represented, partitioned and composed in various ways, recognise patterns in numbers and extend their knowledge of numbers beyond 2 digits
*   use physical or virtual materials and diagrams when modelling practical problems through active learning experiences, recognise existing patterns, employ different strategies and discuss the reasonableness of answers
*   explain ways of making direct and indirect comparisons and begin to use uniform, informal units to measure some attributes
*   reason spatially and use spatial features to classify shapes and objects; they recognise these shapes and objects in their environment and use simple transformations, directions and pathways to move the positions of shapes and objects within a space
*   use simple surveys to collect and sort data, based on a question of interest, recognise that data can be represented in different ways, and explain patterns that they see in the results
*   develop a sense of equivalence, fairness, repetition and variability when they engage in play-based and practical activities
