# Mathematics - Foundation Year {#mathematics-foundation-year}

## Level Description {#level-description}

In Foundation, learning in Mathematics builds on the Early Years Learning Framework and each student’s prior learning and experiences. Students engage in a range of approaches to learning and doing mathematics that develop their understanding of and fluency with concepts, procedures and processes by making connections, reasoning, problem-solving and practice. Proficiency in mathematics enables students to respond to familiar and unfamiliar situations by employing mathematical strategies to make informed decisions and solve problems efficiently.

Students further develop proficiency and positive dispositions towards mathematics and its use as they:

*   explore situations, sparked by curiosity, using physical and virtual materials to represent, sort, quantify, compare and solve everyday problems
*   look for and make connections between number names, numerals and quantities, and compare quantities and shapes, using elementary mathematical reasoning in active learning experiences
*   bring mathematical meaning to their use of familiar terms and language when they pose and respond to questions, and explain their thinking and reasoning
*   build confidence and autonomy in being able to make and justify mathematical decisions based on quantification and direct comparisons
*   learn to recognise repetition in pattern sequences and apply this to creatively build repeating patterns in a range of contexts
*   develop a sense of sameness, difference and change when they engage in play-based activities.

### Number {#number}

##### AC9MFN01 {#ac9mfn01}

name, represent and order numbers including zero to at least 20, using physical and virtual materials and numerals

**Elaborations**
*  responding to a request to collect a quantity of objects or reading a numeral and selecting the associated quantity of items from a collection to match the number required; for example, collecting 9 paint brushes after hearing the word ‘nine’
*  recognising the order in the sequence of numbers to \(20\) and identifying the number that is “one less” than a given number and the number that is “one more”; for example, playing instructive card games that involve reading and ordering number cards; using counting songs, story books and rhymes to establish the forwards and backwards counting sequence of numbers in the context of active counting activities
*  understanding and using terms such as “first”, “second”, “third”, … “fifth”… to indicate ordinal position in a sequence; for example, creating a number track using cards with the numerals zero to \(20\) and describing positions using terms such as first, last, before, after, between
*  recognising, writing and reading numerals written on familiar objects; for example, in images, text or illustrations in story books; writing a numeral on a container as a label to show how many objects it contains
*  connecting quantities to number names and numerals when reading and reciting stories and playing counting games or determining and reasoning about the size of sets of objects within First Nation Australians’ instructive games; for example, Segur etug from Mer Island in the Torres Strait region

##### AC9MFN02 {#ac9mfn02}

recognise and name the number of objects within a collection up to 5 using subitising

**Elaborations**
*  recognising how many objects are in a collection or in images on a card with a quick look and saying the associated number without counting
*  playing instructive card games that rely on the recognition of numbers represented in different ways; for example, playing memory games, matching pairs of quantities on dot cards or similar where the arrangement on each is different; using subitising to compare and order collections and to say who has more when sharing items in a game

##### AC9MFN03 {#ac9mfn03}

quantify and compare collections to at least 20 using counting and explain or demonstrate reasoning

**Elaborations**
*  establishing the language and process of counting, understanding that each object must be counted only once, that the arrangement of objects does not affect how many there are, and that the last number counted answers the question of “How many?”; for example, saying numbers in sequence while playing and performing actions
*  using counting to compare the size of two or more collections of like items to justify which collection contains more or less items
*  using counting and one-to-one correspondence to quantify the number of items required for a purpose; for example, when asked to collect enough scissors for each member of their group to have a pair, counting each member and using the total count to know how many to collect
*  discussing how different cultures may have alternative ways of representing the count; for example, discussing how people of the Asia region use an abacus or Chinese hand gestures
*  using body-tallying that involves body parts and one-to-one correspondence from counting systems of First Nations Peoples of Australia, to count to \(20\)

partition and combine collections up to 10 using part-part-whole relationships and subitising to recognise and name the parts

**Elaborations**
*  recognising numbers represented in physical or virtual ten-frames, and describing their reasoning: “It’s \(7\) because there is \(5\) there and \(2\) more”
*  partitioning collections of up to \(10\) objects in different ways and saying the part-part-whole relationship; for example, partitioning a collection of \(6\) counters into \(4\) counters and \(2\) counters and saying, “\(6\) is \(4\) and \(2\) more, it’s \(2\) and \(4\)”, then partitioning the same collection into \(5\) and one or \(3\) and \(3\)
*  representing part-part-whole relationships in numbers up to \(10\) using physical or virtual materials; for example, identifying numbers represented by dots in standard number configurations such as dominos and dice by recognising parts that form the whole
*  exploring number groupings in First Nations Australians’ counting systems and the different ways of representing these groupings to form and partition numbers, applying this to quantify collections of objects in the environment on Country/Place up to \(10\)

##### AC9MFN05 {#ac9mfn05}

represent practical situations involving addition, subtraction and quantification with physical and virtual materials and use counting or subitising strategies

**Elaborations**
*  using role-play and materials to represent mathematical relationships in stories; for example, “Eight kangaroos were drinking at the river and \(3\) hopped away”; drawing a picture and using materials to represent the situation, discussing, and recording the result of the action with a numeral
*  role playing or actively engaging in situations that involve quantifying or comparing collections of items or simple money transactions; for example, “Do we have enough scissors for our group so that each person has their own pair?”; role-playing using \(\$1\) coins to pay for items in a shop where items are priced in whole dollars
*  representing situations expressed in First Nations Australians’ stories, such as “Tiddalick, the greedy frog”, that describe additive situations and their connections to Country/Place

##### AC9MFN06 {#ac9mfn06}

represent practical situations that involve equal sharing and grouping with physical and virtual materials and use counting or subitising strategies

**Elaborations**
*  using materials to role-play equal sharing; for example, sharing pieces of fruit or a bunch of grapes between \(4\) people and discussing how you would know they have been shared equally; when playing card games where each player is dealt the same number of cards, and counting the number of cards after the deal to ensure they have the same amount
*  representing situations that involve counting several items; for example, \(9\) beads or \(6\) \(\$1\) coins, and sharing them equally between \(3\) people by subitising or counting each group by ones to decide how many beads or coins each person will receive
*  exploring instructive games of First Nations Australians that involve sharing; for example, playing Yangamini of the Tiwi Peoples of Bathurst Island to investigate and discuss equal sharing

*  directly comparing pairs of objects to say which is longer/shorter, and explaining or demonstrating how they know; for example, standing back-to-back to determine who is taller; choosing to line up the bases of a spoon and fork to decide which is longer and explaining why
*  starting \(2\) events at the same time to decide which takes longer; for example, putting on a pair of sandals with buckles or Velcro, describing the duration using familiar terms and reasoning, “I took a longer time because I’m still learning to do up my buckles”
*  directly comparing pairs of everyday objects from the kitchen pantry to say which is heavier/lighter; for example, hefting a tin of baked beans and a packet of marshmallows; comparing the same pair of objects to say which is longer/shorter and discussing comparisons

## Achievement Standards {#achievement-standards}

By the end of Foundation Year, students make connections between number names, numerals and position in the sequence of numbers from zero to at least 20. They use subitising and counting strategies to quantify collections. Students compare the size of collections to at least 20. They partition and combine collections up to 10 in different ways, representing these with numbers. Students represent practical situations that involve quantifying, equal sharing, adding to and taking away from collections to at least 10. They copy and continue repeating patterns.
Students identify the attributes of mass, capacity, length and duration, and use direct comparison strategies to compare objects and events. They sequence and connect familiar events to the time of day. Students name, create and sort familiar shapes and give their reasoning. They describe the position and the location of themselves and objects in relation to other objects and people within a familiar space.
Students collect, sort and compare data in response to questions in familiar contexts.
