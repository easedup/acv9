# Mathematics - Year 5 {#mathematics-year-5}

## Level Description {#level-description}

In Year 5, learning in Mathematics builds on each student’s prior learning and experiences. Students engage in a range of approaches to learning and doing mathematics that develop their understanding of and fluency with concepts, procedures and processes by making connections, reasoning, problem-solving and practice. Proficiency in mathematics enables students to respond to familiar and unfamiliar situations by employing mathematical strategies to make informed decisions and solve problems efficiently.

Students further develop proficiency and positive dispositions towards mathematics and its use as they:

*   apply their understanding of relationships to convert between forms of numbers, units and spatial representations
*   use mathematical modelling to solve practical problems, with guidance, using natural numbers and operations, and report on insights and conclusions they reach about the context
*   use common percentages to make proportional comparisons of quantities
*   use appropriate instruments and digital tools to construct and measure angles in degrees
*   use appropriate metric units to directly measure the area and perimeter of regular and irregular spaces
*   locate and move positions within a grid coordinate system
*   recognise what stays the same and what changes when shapes undergo transformations
*   experiment with factors and multiples using algorithms and digital tools
*   plan, conduct and report findings from statistical investigations that involve an increasing range of types of data and means for representing data
*   develop their reasoning skills when they consider relationships between events and connect long-term frequency over many trials to the likelihood of an event occurring.

interpret, compare and order numbers with more than 2 decimal places, including numbers greater than one, using place value understanding; represent these on a number line

**Elaborations**
*  making models of decimals including tenths, hundredths and thousandths by subdividing materials or grids, and explaining the multiplicative relationship between consecutive places; for example, thousandths are \(10\) times smaller than hundredths; writing numbers into a place value chart to compare and order them
*  renaming decimals to assist with mental computation; for example, when asked to solve \(0.6 ÷ 10\) they rename \(6\) tenths as \(60\) hundredths and say, “if I divide \(60\) hundredths by \(10\), I get \(6\) hundredths” and write \(0.6 ÷ 10 = 0.06\)
*  using a number line or number track to represent and locate decimals with varying numbers of decimal places and numbers greater than one and justifying the placement; for example, \(2.335\) is halfway between \(2.33\) and \(2.34\); that is, \(2.33 < 2.335 < 2.34\) and \(5.283\) is between \(5.28\) and \(5.29\), but closer to \(5.28\)

*  demonstrating and reasoning that all multiples can be formed by combining or regrouping; for example, multiples of \(7\) can be formed by combining a multiple of \(2\) with the corresponding multiple of \(5\); \(3 \times 7 = 3 \times 2 + 3 \times 5\), and \(4 \times 7 = 4 \times 2 + 4 \times 5\)

*  creating a model by subdividing a collection of materials, such as blocks or money, to connect decimals and percentage equivalents of tenths and commonly used fractions \(\frac12\), \(\frac14\) and \(\frac34\); for example, one-tenth or \(0.1\) represents \(10\)% and one half or \(0.5\) represents \(50\)%; recognising that \(60\)% is \(10\)% more than \(50\)%

*  representing and solving addition and subtraction problems involving fractions by using jumps on a number line, bar models or making diagrams of fractions as parts of shapes
*  using materials, diagrams, number lines or arrays to show and explain that fraction number sentences can be rewritten in equivalent forms without changing the quantity; for example, \(\frac12\) + \(\frac14\)  is the same as \(\frac24\) + \(\frac14\)
