# Mathematics - Year 4 {#mathematics-year-4}

## Level Description {#level-description}

In Year 4, learning in Mathematics builds on each student’s prior learning and experiences. Students engage in a range of approaches to learning and doing mathematics that develop their understanding of and fluency with concepts, procedures and processes by making connections, reasoning, problem-solving and practice. Proficiency in mathematics enables students to respond to familiar and unfamiliar situations by employing mathematical strategies to make informed decisions and solve problems efficiently.

Students further develop proficiency and positive dispositions towards mathematics and its use as they:

*   draw on their proficiency with number facts, fractions and decimals to deepen their appreciation of how numbers work
*   develop and use strategies for multiplication that are based on their understanding of multiplication as an operation and their knowledge of laws for arithmetic operations
*   choose and use efficient strategies when modelling problems, communicating their solutions within the context of the situation
*   use algorithms to generate sets of numbers, recognising and describing any patterns that emerge
*   become aware of the importance of context and purpose when they make judgements and reflect on the reasonableness of measurements and the results of calculations, and how they choose to represent mathematics and mathematical information
*   measure and estimate common attributes of objects using conventional instruments and appropriate metric units
*   develop and use surveys to obtain data that is directly relevant to their statistical investigations
*   draw on their reasoning skills to analyse, categorise and order chance events and identify independent and dependent events
*   investigate variability by conducting repeated chance experiments and observing results.
