# Mathematics - Year 6 {#mathematics-year-6}

## Level Description {#level-description}

In Year 6, learning in Mathematics builds on each student’s prior learning and experiences. Students engage in a range of approaches to learning and doing mathematics that develop their understanding of and fluency with concepts, procedures and processes by making connections, reasoning, problem-solving and practice. Proficiency in mathematics enables students to respond to familiar and unfamiliar situations by employing mathematical strategies to make informed decisions and solve problems efficiently.

Students further develop proficiency and positive dispositions towards mathematics and its use as they:

*   expand the repertoire of numbers they work with to include rational numbers and the use of integers in practical contexts such as locating points in the 4 quadrants of a Cartesian plane
*   extend their knowledge of factors and multiples to understand the properties of prime, composite and square numbers
*   solve arithmetic problems involving all 4 operations with natural numbers of any size
*   use mathematical modelling to solve practical problems, choosing models, representations and calculation strategies and justify solutions
*   apply computational approaches to develop algorithms that use rules to generate numbers
*   develop a range of written and digital means for representing objects and three-dimensional spaces in 2 dimensions
*   apply their understanding of area and use multiplicative thinking to establish the formula for the areas of a rectangle
*   begin to formally use deductive reasoning in spatial contexts involving lines and angles
*   describe and compare probabilities numerically
*   determine the mode and range and discuss the shape of distributions in their reports of findings from their statistical investigations
