# Health and Physical Education - Years 7 and 8 {#health-and-physical-education-years-7-and-8}

## Level Description {#level-description}

The Years 7–8 curriculum builds on each student’s prior learning. During this time, a major influence on students is the world around them, and their peers become a key source of motivation and support when managing their health and wellbeing.

Students reflect on factors that influence their perception of themselves and their capacity to be resilient. Students explore behavioural expectations for different social situations. They develop the knowledge, understanding and skills to recognise instances of disrespect, discrimination, harassment and violence, and to act assertively to support their own rights and feelings and those of others.

Students investigate a range of health issues relevant to young people to understand the choices people make about their health and wellbeing. They examine the factors that can influence an individual’s choices, and explore and evaluate options, consequences, and healthier and safer alternatives. Students continue to refine their health literacy skills as well as their understanding of the sources of support available, to seek early help when they or people around them need it.

In these years, Health and Physical Education plays an important role in maintaining physical activity participation, through opportunities for skill development in a variety of movement forms that enhance performance and competence, as well as providing enjoyment and a sense of achievement.

Students practise and apply more complex combinations of skills and strategies in a range of movement situations and settings. They explore the range of factors and movement concepts that influence the quality of movement performances. They practise techniques that can be used to enhance their own and others’ performances.

Students have opportunities to practise using creative and collaborative processes to work in a group or team to communicate effectively, solve problems, resolve conflicts, and make decisions in movement and social contexts.
