# Health and Physical Education - Years 5 and 6 {#health-and-physical-education-years-5-and-6}

## Level Description {#level-description}

The Years 5–6 curriculum builds on each student’s prior learning. During this time, students are taking more responsibility for their own health, physical activity and personal safety.

Students develop optimistic habits in the way they look at themselves, their world and their perception of what the future holds for them. They understand the important role persistence and resilience play in maintaining confidence and commitment to complete tasks.

Most students will be experiencing the physical, emotional and social changes associated with puberty during these years. The content supports learning about these changes and positive ways to manage these transitions. Students also learn about their own unique qualities and explore ways in which people define their own identities and value the diversity within their community.

Students are becoming more conscious of external influences on their attitudes, beliefs and behaviours. They explore how their choices and behaviours influence their health and wellbeing.

Students have frequent opportunities to apply and transfer the movement skills and strategies they have learnt and refined previously into a range of new movement situations. Students explore ways they can actively participate in a range of physical activity settings and contribute to building a healthier community.

Students begin to explore more complex movement concepts and promote safe, equitable and fair participation for all. Students further develop and refine a range of communication and conflict resolution skills and processes, enabling them to interact appropriately and respectfully with others in a range of different movement and social situations.
