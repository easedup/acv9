# Health and Physical Education - Years 9 and 10 {#health-and-physical-education-years-9-and-10}

## Level Description {#level-description}

The Years 9–10 curriculum builds on each student’s prior learning. During this time, students refine their understanding of how they can contribute to individual and community health and wellbeing. Students have frequent opportunities to participate in physical activities, including in outdoor settings, to value the importance of active recreation as a way of enhancing their health and wellbeing throughout their lives.

Students explore practical and creative actions that promote their own health and wellbeing and that of their wider community, such as designing spaces promoting physical activity, active transport options and sustainable strategies for selecting food sources. Practical learning experiences in these years support students to plan, implement, monitor and evaluate personal habits to enhance their wellbeing.

Students explore how societal attitudes and values can reinforce stereotypes and role expectations. They investigate how these can impact young people’s choices in relation to health behaviours, healthcare options, help-seeking strategies and physical activity participation.

Students investigate a range of health issues relevant to young people, including mental health, sexual health, healthy eating, personal and relationship safety, body image and behaviours associated with substance use. As they do so, students further refine their help-seeking strategies, assertive behaviours, conflict resolution and negotiation.

Students have opportunities to explore the nature and benefits of respectful relationships. They further develop skills to manage their relationships as they change over time. They have opportunities to explore empathy, ethical decision-making, respect and consent, and analyse the role they play in establishing and maintaining respectful relationships.

Students practise and refine more specialised movement skills and complex movement strategies and concepts in different movement environments. They apply movement concepts and strategies to evaluate and refine their own and others’ movement performances.

Students further investigate techniques to assess the quality of movement performances. They adapt and improvise their movements to respond to different movement situations, stimuli and challenges. Students refine and consolidate their leadership, teamwork and collaborative skills through participation in a range of physical activities.
