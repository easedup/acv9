# Health and Physical Education - Years 3 and 4

## Level Description

The Years 3–4 curriculum builds on each student’s prior learning. During this time, students are further developing their understanding of themselves and others, and the changing world in which they live.

Through health and movement contexts, student develop personal and social skills such as leadership, communication, collaboration, problem-solving, persistence and decision-making.

Students explore personal and social factors and refine skills that support and contribute to their identities and emotional responses in various situations. They develop strategies for managing the physical, emotional and social changes and transitions they may experience as they grow older. As they continue to build relationships, they develop an understanding of the importance of empathy, diversity, respect and inclusion in initiating and maintaining respectful relationships.

As students enhance their capacity to take responsibility for their health and wellbeing, they examine health messages and factors that motivate or inhibit healthy and safe choices about physical activity and health behaviours.

Students develop greater proficiency across the range of fundamental movement skills by building on previous learning. They practise and refine the skills introduced in the early years and transfer them to unfamiliar movement situations.

Students combine different movement skills in game-like situations to create more complex movement patterns and sequences. Through exploration of, and participation in, a variety of physical activities, students further develop their knowledge about movement, how the body moves and the benefits of regular physical activity.

## Achievement Standards

The Years 3–4 curriculum builds on each student’s prior learning. During this time, students are further developing their understanding of themselves and others, and the changing world in which they live.

Through health and movement contexts, student develop personal and social skills such as leadership, communication, collaboration, problem-solving, persistence and decision-making.

Students explore personal and social factors and refine skills that support and contribute to their identities and emotional responses in various situations. They develop strategies for managing the physical, emotional and social changes and transitions they may experience as they grow older. As they continue to build relationships, they develop an understanding of the importance of empathy, diversity, respect and inclusion in initiating and maintaining respectful relationships.

As students enhance their capacity to take responsibility for their health and wellbeing, they examine health messages and factors that motivate or inhibit healthy and safe choices about physical activity and health behaviours.

Students develop greater proficiency across the range of fundamental movement skills by building on previous learning. They practise and refine the skills introduced in the early years and transfer them to unfamiliar movement situations.

Students combine different movement skills in game-like situations to create more complex movement patterns and sequences. Through exploration of, and participation in, a variety of physical activities, students further develop their knowledge about movement, how the body moves and the benefits of regular physical activity.
