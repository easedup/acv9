# Humanities and Social Sciences - Year 3 {#humanities-and-social-sciences-year-3}

## Level Description {#level-description}

In Year 3, the focus is on **"diverse communities and places, and the contributions people make"**.

The Year 3 curriculum focuses on the diversity of people and places in their local community and beyond, and how people participate in their communities. Through exploring how their community has changed over time, students identify the significant causes, events and people involved in change. They investigate the importance of different events, symbols and emblems in Australia. Students examine the representation of Australia, the location of Australia’s neighbouring countries, and the similarities and differences between places at those scales in terms of natural, managed and constructed features. They explore the interconnections of First Nations Australians in different parts of Australia to Country/Place. Drawing on familiar and local contexts, students develop an understanding of the importance of rules, the consequences of rules not being followed, and how individuals, including themselves, participate in and contribute to their community.

Inquiry questions provide a framework for developing students’ knowledge, understanding and skills. They allow for connections to be made within and across the HASS sub-strands or with other learning areas. The following inquiry questions are examples only and may be used or adapted to suit local contexts.

*   How do symbols, events, individuals and places in my community make it unique?
*   How do people contribute to their communities, past and present?
*   How are people in Australia connected to places and what are the similarities and differences between those places?

## Strands {#strands}

### Knowledge and understanding {#knowledge-and-understanding}

#### History {#history}

##### AC9HS3K01 {#ac9hs3k01}

causes and effects of changes to the local community, and how people who may be from diverse backgrounds have contributed to these changes

**Elaborations**
*  exploring photographs, newspapers, oral histories, diaries and letters to investigate how an aspect of life in the local community, such as transport, entertainment, the natural and built environment, and technologies, has changed over time; for example, from the time of European settlement to the present day
*  comparing photographs from the past and present of a specific location to identify the change or continuity (similarities and differences over time) associated with people, events or developments, places or ecosystems
*  identifying individuals and groups of diverse backgrounds from the past, who have contributed to the community’s economic, social, cultural, civic and environmental development and character
*  investigating reasons for change in the local community, why change was brought about and what happened because of it; for example, the change in use of a building, wasteland turning to wetland

##### AC9HS3K02 {#ac9hs3k02}

significant events, symbols and emblems that are important to Australia’s identity and diversity, and how they are celebrated, commemorated or recognised in Australia, including Australia Day, Anzac Day, NAIDOC Week, National Sorry Day, Easter, Christmas, and other religious and cultural festivals

*  generating a list of local, state/territory, national and religious symbols and emblems (for example, the Commonwealth Coat of Arms, the Australian Flag and First Nations Australians’ flags, state/territory flags and coats of arms, club emblems, school logos, flags, floral emblems, and religious symbols, such as the Christian cross, the Crescent and Star, and the Magen David), and discussing their origins, use and significance

##### AC9HS3K04 {#ac9hs3k04}

the ways First Nations Australians in different parts of Australia are interconnected with Country/Place

the similarities and differences between places in Australia and neighbouring countries in terms of their natural, managed and constructed features

**Elaborations**

who makes rules, why rules are important in the school and/or the local community, and the consequences of rules not being followed

**Elaborations**
*  developing and justifying a set of fair rules and consequences for the class
*  identifying familiar rules, how rules protect the rights of others, what their responsibilities are to others, and the consequences when rules are not followed
*  exploring who has the authority to make rules in different contexts (for example, parents, teachers, coaches) and considering why rules differ across these contexts, such as a school playground, in class, at home, or in sport
*  discussing situations where it is not fair to have one rule that treats everyone the same; for example, if some people, such as students with disability, have different needs or would be unable to follow the rules

## Achievement Standards {#achievement-standards}

By the end of Year 3, students describe the causes, effects and contributions of people to change. They identify the significance of events, symbols and emblems to Australia’s identity and diversity. They describe the representation of places within and near Australia. They identify the similarities, differences and connections of people to places across those scales. Students describe the importance of rules and people’s contributions to communities. Students develop questions and locate, collect and record information and data from different sources. They interpret information and data in different formats. They analyse information and data to identify perspectives and they draw conclusions. They propose actions or responses. Students use ideas from sources, and subject-specific terms to present descriptions and explanations.
