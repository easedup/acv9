# Humanities and Social Sciences - Year 5 {#humanities-and-social-sciences-year-5}

## Level Description {#level-description}

In Year 5, the focus is on **"Australian communities – their past, present and possible futures"**.

The Year 5 curriculum focuses on the development of colonial Australia after 1800, the relationship between humans and their environment, the development of the economy, the features of Australian democracy and citizenship. Students learn about the reasons for the founding of a British colony in Australia, the impact of colonisation on the environment, and the daily lives of different people within and around the colony. They explore the roles of people, including migrants and First Nations Australians, in the development of events in an Australian colony. Students explore the human influences on the characteristics of a place and the way spaces in the Australian landscape are managed, including the management of severe weather events. Students investigate the key values and features of Australia’s democracy. They determine how people in the community cooperate to achieve civic goals. Students develop an understanding of natural, human and capital resources, and how they satisfy human needs and wants.

Inquiry questions provide a framework for developing students’ knowledge, understanding and skills. They allow for connections to be made within and across the HASS sub-strands or with other learning areas. The following inquiry questions are examples only and may be used or adapted to suit local contexts.

*   How have individuals and groups in the past and present contributed to the development of Australia?
*   How do people influence environments, and how do consumers and citizens contribute to a sustainable Australia?
*   How have people enacted their values, beliefs and responsibilities about people, places and events, past and present?

the management of Australian environments, including managing severe weather events such as bushfires, floods, droughts or cyclones, and their consequences

**Elaborations**
*  exploring how environments are used and managed, such as the practices and laws that aim to manage human impact, the use of zoning to manage local environments, creation of wildlife corridors and national parks
*  examining how changes due to environmental practices create issues, such as water shortages and increased floods and bushfires, the impact of issues on places and communities, and how people can mitigate the impacts, for example through building codes, zoning, firebreaks and controlled burns, and efficient irrigation

##### AC9HS5S06 {#ac9hs5s06}

propose actions or responses to issues or challenges and use criteria to assess the possible effects

**Elaborations**

*  undertaking a project that responds to an identified challenge or issue with strategies to be used that will achieve desired outcomes; for example, a school fundraising activity, an ecological preservation project, a school-based opinion poll about a relevant issue
*  asking questions in order to consider potential effects; for example, “What could be the effects of my purchasing decisions?”, “Are needs and wants the same for everyone?”, “Why can’t all needs and wants be satisfied?”, “How can I contribute to a sustainable environment?”
*  participating in a relevant democratic process, such as class votes, mock parliament and school decision-making processes such as student councils
*  making judgements about how effectively challenges have been addressed in the past (for example, relative success of a response to challenges during colonial settlement) or how effectively a current challenge is being addressed (for example, a response to an environmental issue or a strategy for economic development)
*  using criteria to evaluate the possible options that people could take to resolve challenges, such as improving water quality, managing excess waste and providing resources, and using criteria to improve responses in communities to environmental hazards; for example, considering economic factors such as needs, wants and costs, as well as environmental, health and social factors
