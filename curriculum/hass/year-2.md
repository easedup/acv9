# Humanities and Social Sciences - HASS F-6 - Year 2

## Level Description

In Year 2, the focus is on **"past and present connections to people and places"**.

The Year 2 curriculum builds on each student’s prior learning and experiences investigating the past and places. Through exploring the history of their local community and places across a range of scales, students develop an understanding of how connections to history and place shape identity, diversity, connection and belonging. They consider how they can contribute to their world by exploring perspectives on the historical, cultural or spiritual significance of a person, place and/or building. Students continue to develop skills and processes to investigate the history of their local community and places across a range of scales. They develop dispositions for learning such as curiosity, imagination, problem-solving and researching. They resource their own learning through connecting with people, places and technologies.

The Year 2 curriculum extends contexts for study from the local to the regional and state/territory, exploring connections between the past and present, and between people and places. Through studies of their local area, students explore, recognise and appreciate the history of their community, and what it reveals about significant people or places. They examine the causes and effects of changes in communication and transport technology. Students learn about the scale by which places are defined. They learn about the ways local people and places are connected to people and places at broader scales within their region, state or territory. Students explore how places have meaning to people and the connection First Nations Australians have with local Country/Place.

Inquiry questions provide a framework for developing students’ knowledge, understanding and skills. They allow for connections to be made within and across the HASS sub-strands or with other learning areas. The following inquiry questions are examples only and may be used or adapted to suit local contexts.

*   What does my place tell me about the past and present?
*   How are people connected to their place and other places, past or present?
*   How has technology affected daily life over time and the connections between people in different places?

## Strands

*  identifying and designing a local historical tour of a building or site; for example, one related to a particular cultural group

##### AC9HS2K02

how technological developments changed people’s lives at home, and in the ways they worked, travelled and communicated

**Elaborations**
*  examining changes in technologies over several generations by comparing past and present objects and photographs, and discussing how these changes have shaped people’s lives; for example, changes to land, air and sea transport; the introduction of transistors, television, FM radio moving to digital streaming, including how people communicated over long distances
*  identifying, through questioning adults, the communication, work and transport technologies used in the childhoods of their grandparents or familiar elders
*  suggesting what their pattern of visits to places might have been one or two generations ago and comparing this to their current pattern
*  identifying the technologies used by local First Nations Australians for aspects of daily life such as providing food, shelter and transportation
*  identifying the ways current communication and transport technologies impact on our interconnections with other places; for example, online communication, accessibility to other places through different types of transport

#### Geography

##### AC9HS2K03

how places can be spatially represented in geographical divisions from local to regional to state/territory, and how people and places are interconnected across those scales

**Elaborations**
*  identifying where they live in Australia, including in relation to their nearest capital city, the region and state/territory on a map and a globe
*  investigating the places locally and at a broader scale that they and their families visit for shopping, health, recreation, religious or ceremonial activities, or other reasons
*  identifying links they and other people in their community have with people and places at the regional and/or state/territory scale; for example, where produce in their supermarket comes from or produce from their farms goes to, relatives they visit, places they go for holidays
*  describing how communication and transport technologies connect their place to other places at the regional and/or state/territory level; for example, online communication, phone, road, rail, planes, ferries

##### AC9HS2K04

the interconnections of First Nations Australians to a local Country/Place

**Elaborations**
*  listening to stories connecting local First Nations Australians with the land, sea, waterways, sky and animals of their Country/Place
*  liaising with community to identify language groups of First Nations Australians who belong to the local area and exploring the relationship between language, Country/Place and spirituality (this is intended to be a local area study with a focus on one language group; however, if information or sources are not readily available, another representative area may be studied)
*  discussing when to use Acknowledgement of Country and Welcome to Country at ceremonies and events to respectfully recognise the Country/Place and Traditional Owners and Custodians of the land, sea, waterways, and sky

### Skills

#### Questioning and researching

##### AC9HS2S01

develop questions about objects, people, places and events in the past and present

**Elaborations**
*  developing inquiry questions about a historical site; for example, “What does it look like now?”, “What condition is it in?”, “What was its purpose?”, “How might its use have changed?”, “How was it built/created?”, “Who built it?”, “How is it now used?”, “Why is it important?”, “Was/is it used by different groups of people?’
*  developing inquiry questions about places; for example, “What are the features of the place?”, “How far away is it?”, “How easy is it to get to?”, “How am I connected to it?”, “How is it connected to other places?”
*  posing questions using the stems, “How do I feel about …?”, ‘What would it be like to …?” and “What effect …?”

##### AC9HS2S02

collect, sort and record information and data from observations and from provided sources, including unscaled timelines and labelled maps or models

**Elaborations**
*  collecting information from sources and observations relevant to learning about the past (for example, photographs, interviews, newspapers, stories, and place and street names in maps) and relevant to learning about places (for example, surveying peers, satellite images, diagrams, field photographs, observations of monuments, built and non-built historical landmarks, middens, remnants of native vegetation and old building remains), and identifying relevant information
*  creating pictorial maps with annotations to show historical sites or places they are connected to, incorporating symbols to show locations of objects, places or significant features
