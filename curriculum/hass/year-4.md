# Humanities and Social Sciences - Year 4 {#humanities-and-social-sciences-year-4}

## Level Description {#level-description}

In Year 4, the focus is on **"how people, places and environments interact, past and present"**.

The Year 4 curriculum focuses on interactions between people, places and environments over time and space, and the effects of these interactions. Students develop understandings about the causes and nature of significant events related to the First Fleet and the experiences of people involved in colonisation prior to 1800. They study the diversity of First Nations Australians prior to colonisation, their continuous connection to Country/Place, and the impacts of contact on them and their Countries/Places. Students examine the ways in which environments are important to people and animals, as well as the ways people sustainably allocate and manage renewable and non-renewable resources. Students’ understanding of democratic decision-making is developed through investigating the role of their local government and the contribution of citizens to their community. They examine how rules and laws affect them and the importance of laws in society. Students explore cultural diversity in their community and how belonging to different groups can shape personal identity.

Inquiry questions provide a framework for developing students’ knowledge, understanding and skills. They allow for connections to be made within and across the HASS sub-strands or with other learning areas. The following inquiry questions are examples only and may be used or adapted to suit local contexts.

*   How have diverse individuals and groups, past and present, contributed to the Australian community?
*   Why did Britain want to establish a colony in Australia?
*   What were the effects of European colonisation on Australia, and on Australian First Nations Peoples?
*   What is the significance of the environment, and what are different views on how it can be used and sustained, past and present?

##### AC9HS4S01 {#ac9hs4s01}

develop questions to guide investigations about people, events, places and issues

**Elaborations**
*  asking questions before, during and after an investigation using tools such as a KWL chart (what they know, what they want to know and what they have learned) and five W’s + H (who, what, when, where, why and how)

##### AC9HS4S02 {#ac9hs4s02}

locate, collect and record information and data from a range of sources, including annotated timelines and maps

**Elaborations**
*  identifying the types of sources suited to historical, geographical, civic inquiry contexts (for example, paintings, maps and written records/accounts to investigate the First Fleet or a local environment; newspaper articles and database information to investigate the cultural diversity of the local community or to respond to a civic or geographic issue such as recycling; traditional ballads and stories to investigate historical events or cultural groups in the community) and discussing why particular sources might be suitable for a particular context
*  brainstorming ways that information might be collected for an inquiry, such as surveys, interviews and tallying, and choosing, with teacher guidance, the most effective sources of data; for example, the internet, thematic maps, photographs, satellite imagery, field data collection, interviewing members of local government
*  exploring stories about the groups people belong to; for example, cultural groups such as groups that value First Nations Australian or Asian heritage; interest and community groups such as recreational and volunteering organisations; and gender or religious groups
*  using graphic organisers, timelines, maps, graphs or tables to display data and information (for example, a food web; consequence wheels for an issue; creating a timeline related to the First Fleet; mapping locations of different types of vegetation, the loss of native species, the movement of peoples over time, or social, cultural and religious groups in Australia’s society) and using digital applications as appropriate

##### AC9HS4S06 {#ac9hs4s06}

propose actions or responses to an issue or challenge that consider possible effects of actions

**Elaborations**
*  participating in cooperative strategies that enable decision-making about roles and responsibilities in relation to an issue that may be of concern to the students (for example, waste management in their school or protecting a habitat for an endangered species) and identifying resources needed to support the actions and likely outcomes
*  forecasting a probable future and a preferred future relating to an environmental, local government or cultural issue; for example, developing a future scenario of what oceans will be like if humans continue to allow waste plastic to enter waterways, and a preferred scenario of what oceans would be like if plastics were to be replaced by degradable materials
*  reflecting on personal behaviours and identifying attitudes that may affect aspects of the environment at a local or global level; for example, pouring paints down the sink, using products sourced from cleared rainforests and proposing awareness-raising strategies to reduce impacts on the environment
*  proposing possible actions that could be taken to address an issue (for example, improving the management of waste in the school, choosing products not made from endangered species or their habitats) and identifying resources needed to support the actions and likely outcomes (for example, composting lunch waste and using it on the school garden, making socially responsible decisions)

## Achievement Standards {#achievement-standards}

By the end of Year 4, students describe the diversity of experiences of people in Australia prior to and following 1788. They describe the events and causes of the establishment of the first British colony in Australia. They describe the effects of colonisation on people and environments. Students describe the importance of environments, and sustainable allocation and management of resources. They describe the importance and role of local government, community members and laws, and the cultural and social factors that shape identity.

Students develop questions and locate, collect and record information and data from a range of sources and formats. They interpret and analyse information and data to identify perspectives, and draw conclusions. Students propose considered actions or responses. Students use ideas from sources and relevant subject-specific terms to present descriptions and explanations.
