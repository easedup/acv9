# Humanities and Social Sciences - Year 6 {#humanities-and-social-sciences-year-6}

## Level Description {#level-description}

In Year 6, the focus is **"Australia in the past and present, and its connections with a diverse world"**.

The Year 6 curriculum focuses on the social, economic and political development of Australia as a nation, particularly after 1900, and Australia’s role within a diverse and interconnected world today. Students explore the factors that led to Federation, the Constitution and our democratic system of government. Through studies of people’s experiences of democracy and citizenship over time, students come to understand the significance of events, ideas and people’s contributions in influencing the development of Australia’s system of government. They learn about the way of life of people who have migrated to Australia since Federation and their contributions to Australia’s development. Students explore the geographical diversity of the Asian region and how our interconnections with other countries change people and places. They study the key institutions of Australia’s democratic government, and the key values and beliefs of Western democracies. Students learn about the roles and responsibilities of local, state and federal governments. They learn about the factors that influence consumer choices and how they can develop strategies to make informed consumer and financial choices.

Inquiry questions provide a framework for developing students’ knowledge, understanding and skills. They allow for connections to be made within and across the HASS sub-strands or with other learning areas. The following inquiry questions are examples only and may be used or adapted to suit local contexts.

*   How have key figures, events and values shaped Australian society, its system of government and citizenship?
*   How have experiences of democracy and citizenship differed between groups over time and place, and what is the role of citizens in contributing to environmental, economic and social sustainability?
*   How has Australia developed as a society with global connections, and in what ways is Australia similar and different to other countries?
