# Digital Technologies - Foundation Year {#digital-technologies-foundation-year}

## Level Description {#level-description}

Learning in Digital Technologies builds on the Early Years Learning Framework and each student’s prior learning and experiences.

By the end of Foundation students should have had the opportunity to experience computational thinking by experimenting with different ways of representing an idea or action with a symbol, object or picture that is understood by others, such as a sun indicating fine conditions in a weather forecast.

Through Digital Technologies and Mathematics (_Statistics_), students have opportunities to explore different ways that data can be acquired and recorded, for example using a tablet to take photographs of plants in the school garden. Students have opportunities to develop their confidence with using digital systems by creating content such as simple messages. They become familiar with the difference between data that is owned by them, such as a photo of themselves, and data that is publicly available, such as a photo of their school. Through guided play experiences and tasks, students develop systems thinking by exploring how digital systems, such as tablets, smartphones and laptops can be used for different purposes, at school and at home.

In Digital Technologies, students should have frequent opportunities for authentic learning by making key connections with other learning areas.

## Strands {#strands}

### Knowledge and understanding {#knowledge-and-understanding}

#### Digital systems {#digital-systems}

##### AC9TDIFK01 {#ac9tdifk01}

recognise and explore digital systems (hardware and software) for a purpose

**Elaborations**
*  recognising digital systems that they interact with at home and school, for example smartphone, laptop or programmable toy
*  playing with (with guidance) and using different digital systems to explore what they do for a purpose, for example the class speaking to an expert via videoconference
*  recording, with permission, audio or video of local community members' stories to share in class, for example sharing cultural stories of First Nations Australians
*  taking photos, with permission, to share with others, for example close-up photos of First Nations Australians' material culture, such as woven mats or baskets revealing intricate detail
*  making a model of a digital system, using it in a role-play scenario and describing its features, for example a cardboard box with a keyboard and screen with app icons

#### Data representation {#data-representation}

##### AC9TDIFK02 {#ac9tdifk02}

represent data as objects, pictures and symbols

**Elaborations**
*  drawing a picture representing each of their family members and their interests, for example drawing one family member with a surfboard and another with a skateboard
*  using coloured blocks to represent an attribute of people, for example representing students and their sports houses with different coloured blocks
*  using a symbol to represent an idea, but knowing that the symbol is not the data itself, for example the symbols and colour on both the Australian Aboriginal flag and the Torres Strait Islander flag

### Processes and production skills {#processes-and-production-skills}

#### Privacy and security {#privacy-and-security}

##### AC9TDIFP01 {#ac9tdifp01}

identify some data that is personal and owned by them

**Elaborations**
*  listing things that contain personal and public data, for example photos of themselves with their family (private) and photos of local community sites (public)
*  identifying apps and websites they use where their personal data could be made visible, for example photos of themselves on parents' or carers’ social media, or their username being shown to others in online games

## Achievement Standards {#achievement-standards}

### Learning area achievement standard {#learning-area-achievement-standard}
By the end of Foundation students identify familiar products, services and environments and develop familiarity with digital systems, using them for a purpose. They create, communicate and choose design ideas. Students follow steps and use materials and equipment to safely make a designed solution for a school-selected context. They show how to represent data using objects, pictures and symbols and identify examples of data that is owned by them.

### Subject achievement standard {#subject-achievement-standard}
By the end of Foundation students show familiarity with digital systems and use them for a purpose. They represent data using objects, pictures and symbols and identify examples of data that is owned by them.
