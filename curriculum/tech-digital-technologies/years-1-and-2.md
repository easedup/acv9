# Technologies - Digital Technologies - Years 1 and 2

## Level Description

By the end of Year 2 students should have had the opportunity to apply computational thinking by describing algorithms that include sequences of instructions and decisions, and by using digital systems to produce simple solutions. Through practice and investigation, they become more familiar with and confident in representing data in different ways.

Through Digital Technologies and Mathematics (_Statistics_), students begin to recognise patterns in the data they have acquired, such as identifying common and distinctive features after sorting it, and these generalisations help them make predictions, such as how a pattern might continue.

Students develop systems thinking by exploring a range of purposes for using digital systems and their components. They have opportunities to experience and develop their skills in using different hardware components, such as a touchpad and keyboard. They use different software to create content such as writing a message that includes an image and sharing it with classmates. Students become aware of design thinking by discussing and observing how the needs of different people are met through using digital systems. They protect the security of their own data on their school account by using their own username and password and, through discussion, develop an awareness that some websites and apps store their personal data online.

In Digital Technologies, students should have frequent opportunities for authentic learning by making key connections with other learning areas.

## Strands

### Knowledge and understanding

#### Digital systems

##### AC9TDI2K01

identify and explore digital systems and their components for a purpose

**Elaborations**
*  exploring digital systems to better understand how they are used to provide communities with essential services, for example looking at the systems and components that allow First Nations Australians in communities classified as remote to watch their favourite television shows
*  naming and using digital systems that they interact with at home and school, for example using a touchpad to move the cursor on a laptop, or the keyboard to type a simple message on a tablet
*  using different digital systems to explore what they do and how to use them, for example selecting the camera icon allows them to take photos of things that are a familiar shape

#### Data representation

##### AC9TDI2K02

represent data as pictures, symbols, numbers and words

**Elaborations**
*  recognising that letter combinations represent different phonemes and that words are spelled the same way regardless of the accent of the speaker
*  recognising the equivalence of different representations of numbers, including words, digits and tally marks
*  recognising that pictures in First Nations Australians’ seasonal calendars are used to represent and communicate data, such as how the appearance of a flower can signify a connected event or a resource availability, for example how the Gulumoerrgin Peoples from the Darwin region of the Northern Territory understand that the fruiting of freshwater mangrove signifies it is time to harvest magpie geese

### Processes and production skills

#### Investigating and defining

##### AC9TDI2P01

investigate simple problems for known users that can be solved with digital systems

**Elaborations**
*  investigating internet-based translation tools and how similar digital tools could promote the use of First Nations Australians’ languages or assist communications, for example responding to cultural stories of Australian First Nations Peoples
*  investigating familiar and easily understood problems with few complications or steps needed to solve them, for example deciding what to wear by checking the forecast on a weather app
*  identifying how digital systems are used to solve problems at school, for example taking attendance or borrowing a library book
*  exploring how a familiar problem could be solved using a robot, for example creating a model robot using cardboard boxes and explaining how it could be used to clean up the classroom floor at the end of the day

#### Generating and designing

##### AC9TDI2P02

follow and describe algorithms involving a sequence of steps, branching (decisions) and iteration (repetition)

**Elaborations**
*  following a short, ordered sequence of steps and making decisions to solve a simple problem, for example follow a recipe or directions to reach a location
*  describing the steps and decisions (in the correct order) needed to solve a simple problem, for example writing, saying, drawing or photographing the steps needed to make a sandwich
*  rearranging into the correct order a series of mixed-up pictures that describe a story, for example stories authored and published by First Nations Australians
*  identifying the steps needed to solve a problem, and understanding when their order is important, for example socks must be put on before shoes but a jumper can be put on before or after shoes
*  identifying the decisions needed to solve a problem and the next steps to follow in each case, for example if it is raining, take a raincoat, otherwise take a hat
*  following algorithms that repeat a single step a fixed number of times, for example practise spelling a word 5 times or throw and catch a ball with a partner 10 times

#### Evaluating

##### AC9TDI2P03

discuss how existing digital systems satisfy identified needs for known users

**Elaborations**
*  describing how familiar digital systems meet the needs of individuals, for example how different family members use a tablet for different needs – to play videos, read the news or follow a recipe
*  discussing how we use digital systems to store and access information, and how that information helps us learn about our environment, interactions and leisure activities, for example how interactive versions of stories authored and published by First Nations Australians preserve important cultural expressions
*  sharing ideas about how digital systems are used at school for learning, for example sharing a student's work with the class on an interactive display screen to provide class feedback on their writing
*  sharing and describing ways that common digital systems can be used to meet communication needs, for example tablets can be used as phones and tools for communication between families living in different locations

#### Collaborating and managing

##### AC9TDI2P04

use the basic features of common digital tools to create, locate and communicate content

**Elaborations**
*  using familiar digital systems to create content with others, for example using presentation software to retell a story
*  taking, storing safely and presenting photos of class work, for example locating photos they took of their work to show to parents or carers or for the teacher to upload to the class shared folder
*  finding images of (local) Australian flora and fauna or places for use in a story and including First Nations Australians’ names for the items
*  using a camera or drawing app to create a picture, for example making a card for a family member that includes a photo and short message
*  creating individual pieces of work that contribute to a group task, for example each student contributes a recipe and photo of their favourite food to create a class recipe book

##### AC9TDI2P05

use the basic features of common digital tools to share content and collaborate demonstrating agreed behaviours, guided by trusted adults

**Elaborations**
*  taking and sharing photos of class work with parents or carers using classroom messaging software with teacher guidance
*  applying agreed standards of behaviour when sharing content with classmates, for example using language that is considered by all students and the teacher to be appropriate when they are writing messages to each other
*  considering the need for online safety when sharing information, for example recognising that personal information such as a photo can be used inappropriately

#### Privacy and security

##### AC9TDI2P06

access their school account with a recorded username and password

**Elaborations**
*  using username and password recorded in a private place to access a digital system, for example logging into a school computer using details given on a card by the teacher

##### AC9TDI2P07

discuss that some websites and apps store their personal data online

**Elaborations**
*  sharing examples of the data collected by apps and websites they commonly use, for example usernames and email addresses used by school websites and games to log in
*  discussing the importance of asking permission from a parent or carer before entering personal details online such as address, phone number and date of birth

## Achievement Standards

By the end of Year 2 students show how simple digital solutions meet a need for known users. Students represent and process data in different ways. They follow and describe basic algorithms involving a sequence of steps and branching. With assistance, students access and use digital systems for a purpose. They use the basic features of common digital tools to create, locate and share content, and to collaborate, following agreed behaviours. Students recognise that digital tools may store their personal data online.
