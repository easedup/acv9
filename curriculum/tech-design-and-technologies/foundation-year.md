# Design and Technologies - Foundation Year {#design-and-technologies-foundation-year}

## Level Description {#level-description}

Learning in Design and Technologies builds on the Early Years Learning Framework, and each student’s prior learning and experiences.

By the end of Foundation students should have had the opportunity to create at least one type of designed solution for one of the technologies contexts or one identified by the school. There are rich connections to Digital Technologies, and other learning areas, including Science and Humanities and Social Sciences.

Students should have opportunities to experience designing and producing a product, service or environment. They explore technologies – materials and equipment – through play experiences in a context and generate ideas to design a solution for a purpose. Students develop an awareness of how people design products, services and environments. They evaluate design ideas and choose the most suitable idea. Students use a range of methods to communicate design ideas, including drawings or models, for example changing perspectives from front view to plan view. They explore working with materials such as cardboard, fabric and other common household items and using equipment such as scissors, glues, trowels or kitchen utensils. Students learn techniques to safely make a designed solution.

## Strands {#strands}

### Knowledge and understanding {#knowledge-and-understanding}

#### Technologies and society {#technologies-and-society}

##### AC9TDEFK01 {#ac9tdefk01}

explore how familiar products, services and environments are designed by people

**Elaborations**
*  identifying how First Nations Australians have long designed and produced domestic items including clothing, tools and shelter, for example the Lamalama Peoples of the eastern Cape York Peninsula weave the reddish coloured fibres from *Acacia latifolia* alternately with white coloured fibres from *Brachychiton diversifolium* to produce a striped woven bag
*  exploring how local delivery services meet different needs of people, for example describing how gift packages can be sent to and from people who live in different locations and how online shopping items arrive at a person’s home
*  exploring how an environment such as a local playground may have shade structures to protect users and be designed to allow access for all
*  describing how community gardens, public swimming pools and parks are designed to help people stay healthy
*  asking questions about the design of products from the local store, for example why certain packaging materials might have been selected, and how people design the text and images on the packaging to attract people’s attention

### Processes and production skills {#processes-and-production-skills}

#### Designing and making {#designing-and-making}

##### AC9TDEFP01 {#ac9tdefp01}

generate, communicate and evaluate design ideas, and use materials, equipment and steps to safely make a solution for a purpose

**Elaborations**
*  identifying a purpose for designing and making a solution, for example the sand keeps blowing out of the sandpit, the birds keep flying into the waste bin and taking food scraps or people with disability need to know where they can park at school
*  exploring ideas by drawing or modelling and choosing the most suitable idea, for example drawing or modelling designs for bee hotels to attract native bees to the school garden and choosing one to make, and changing perspectives from front view to plan view
*  evaluating what they have made using personal preferences, for example using a smiley face Likert scale
*  exploring how available materials can be used or re-used in construction play, for example using blocks and rain gutters or cardboard to make a ramp to roll a ball or toy car down
*  practising a range of technical skills safely using equipment, for example joining techniques when making a product from materials, such as a greenhouse to keep a seedling warm or a trellis for holding up tomato plants
*  assembling components of systems and checking they function as planned, for example making and testing a bowling, stacking or obstacle game with discarded food containers or packaging

## Achievement Standards {#achievement-standards}

### Learning area achievement standard {#learning-area-achievement-standard}
By the end of Foundation students identify familiar products, services and environments and develop familiarity with digital systems, using them for a purpose. They create, communicate and choose design ideas. Students follow steps and use materials and equipment to safely make a designed solution for a school-selected context. They show how to represent data using objects, pictures and symbols and identify examples of data that is owned by them.

### Subject achievement standard {#subject-achievement-standard}
By the end of Foundation students identify familiar products, services and environments. They create a designed solution for a school-selected context. Students create, communicate and choose design ideas. They follow steps and use materials and equipment to safely make a designed solution.
