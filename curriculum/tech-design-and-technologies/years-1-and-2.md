# Design and Technologies - Years 1 and 2 {#design-and-technologies-years-1-and-2}

## Level Description {#level-description}

By the end of Year 2 students should have had the opportunity to create 3 types of designed solutions, and addressed each of these 2 technologies contexts:

*   Engineering principles and systems; Materials and technologies specialisations
*   Food and fibre production; Food specialisations.

Students should have opportunities to experience designing and producing products, services and environments. There are rich connections to Digital Technologies, and other learning areas, including Science and Humanities and Social Sciences.

Students explore and investigate technologies – tools, equipment, processes, materials, systems and components – including their purposes and how they meet personal and social needs within local settings. Students learn about how society and environmental sustainability factors influence design and technologies decisions. They begin to consider the impact of their decisions and of technologies on others and the environment.

They evaluate designed solutions using questions such as: How does it work? What purpose does it meet? Who will use it? What do I like about it? How can it be improved? They reflect on their participation in a design process. This involves students developing new perspectives and engaging in different forms of evaluating products, services and environments based on their personal preferences.

Students use a range of technologies to communicate and explain design ideas, including drawings and models. They label drawings and draw objects as 2-dimensional images from different views.

They plan steps, follow directions and manage their own role to complete their own or group design projects. Students are aware of the need to work safely and cooperatively when making designed solutions.

*  exploring where plants and animals are grown for food, clothing and shelter in Australia, for example citrus fruit in South Australia; cotton in New South Wales, which is harvested and made into yarn and fabric for clothing; or timber for building homes from sustainable forests in Tasmania
*  identifying products that can be designed and produced from plants and animals, for example food products, paper and wood products, fabrics and yarns
*  considering a range of tools and equipment that can be used to grow plants for a purpose and their suitability, for example naming and describing tools such as a spade or rake used to cultivate or mulch a home vegetable garden, or equipment such as a seed spreader or global positioning system (GPS) tractor to sow wheat, or a tubestock planting tool and drones to manage forestry plantations

##### AC9TDE2K04 {#ac9tde2k04}

explore how food can be selected and prepared for healthy eating

**Elaborations**
*  <p>identifying a wide range of foods, categorising them into food groups according to the <em>Australian Guide to Healthy Eating</em> and discussing ways to eat a variety of food groups, including cooking methods, tools and equipment needed to prepare them for healthy eating</p>
*  exploring how people including peoples from the countries of Asia design and produce food for healthy eating based on the available plants and animals in their region, the influence of cultural practices, and locally available tools and equipment
*  <p>exploring the <em>Australian Guide to Healthy Eating</em> and the <em>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Guide to Healthy Eating</em> and identifying foods in each of the 5 food groups which contribute to health and wellbeing, for example choosing foods from each of the 5 food groups which they are familiar with and designing a menu for a day</p>
*  exploring the local supermarket to observe the variety of foods and the placement of foods on shelves, in aisles and displays; and considering how their design may influence the purchase of foods for healthy food eating
*  exploring different ways of preparing the products from the school kitchen garden, farmers’ market or supermarket, for example preparing vegetables for a salad, steaming or roasting vegetables and noticing the changes in flavour and texture

## Achievement Standards {#achievement-standards}

By the end of Year 2 students describe the purpose of familiar products, services and environments. For each of the 2 prescribed technologies contexts they describe the features and uses of technologies and create designed solutions. Students select design ideas based on their personal preferences. They communicate design ideas using models and drawings and follow sequenced steps to safely produce designed solutions.
