# Media Arts - Years 1 and 2 {#media-arts-years-1-and-2}

## Level Description {#level-description}

In this band, learning in The Arts builds on each student’s prior learning and experiences. Students continue to learn through purposeful and creative play in structured learning programs designed to foster a strong sense of wellbeing and develop their connection with and contribution to the world. They work individually and in collaboration with peers and teachers drawing on their imaginations, works of fiction, real-life experiences and learnings from across the curriculum to support their engagement in arts learning, as artists and as audiences.

Students explore media arts works that they experience at home, school or through family and community events. They connect with media artists who live and work in the community; for example, by visiting arts spaces or exploring media arts works and experiences such as in-person or online screenings, exhibitions and presentations. They use stimulus materials such as images, events, texts, questions and/or observations as inspiration for their own media arts works. These experiences support students to develop aesthetic knowledge across cognitive, sensory, emotive and physical domains, and to value media arts works and practices from across cultures, communities and/or other contexts.

In this band, the focus is on students:

1.  exploring and responding to

*   media arts works and media arts practices they experience across cultures, communities and/or other contexts
*   examples of media arts works created by First Nations Australians

3.  developing critical and creative practices and skills

*   creative practices for using media languages and available technologies
*   critical practices for observing, reflecting on and responding to media they experience (including their own media arts works)

5.  creating media arts works by selecting and combining images, sounds, text and/or interactive elements to construct representations
6.  presenting/sharing media arts works they have created in informal settings such as classroom presentations.

### Exploring and responding {#exploring-and-responding}

##### AC9AMA2E01 {#ac9ama2e01}

explore where, why and how people across cultures, communities and/or other contexts experience media arts

**Elaborations**
*  identifying where they might experience media arts works in their lives and communities; for example, considering how media arts works communicate cultural knowledge and the purpose of a range of media types
*  using Viewpoints to ask questions about societies and cultures; for example, “What story is this media arts work telling me/us?”, “Who made this media arts work?”, “Where is this media arts work from?”
*  discussing the roles of media artists and what permission means; for example, deciding on a class set of rules for using and creating images, sounds and text in media arts works
*  considering how media arts works communicate and celebrate cultural knowledge in their own communities; for example, through podcasts or animated children’s shows

##### AC9AMA2E02 {#ac9ama2e02}

explore examples of media arts produced and/or distributed by First Nations Australians

**Elaborations**
*  exploring when, where, how and why First Nations Australians use media arts works to share knowledge about their cultures; for example, during celebrations such as National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children’s Day, NAIDOC Week, Reconciliation Week or the acknowledgement of significant occasions including Sorry Day
*  exploring children’s television programs, cartoons/animations and child-focused print media, such as an advertisement encouraging people to adopt a healthy lifestyle, created and distributed by First Nations Australians
*  observing how visual, audio and/or interactive elements are used in media arts works created by First Nations Australians; for example, exploring colours, symbols and patterns used in media arts works with representatives of the First Nations Australian community or through resources that are created or co-created by First Nations Australians
*  exploring media arts works created and/or co-created by First Nations Australians that communicate cultural narratives

### Developing practices and skills {#developing-practices-and-skills}

##### AC9AMA2D01 {#ac9ama2d01}

explore ways of using media technologies responsibly to capture and organise images, sounds, text and/or interactive elements

**Elaborations**
*  exploring ways to use digital tools to capture moving image; for example, using a digital device to capture and manipulate short videos, add sound effects or voice-overs, and considering how best to combine the visual and audio elements to communicate ideas or a narrative
*  exploring how sound can be used to communicate ideas; for example, creating sound effects using found objects or sound recording technology to integrate with a picture book story
*  experimenting with images; for example, retelling the story of a school day using a digital camera to capture still or moving images and adding appropriate captions
*  experimenting with ways that media artists communicate with audiences by combining text, symbols and images; for example, combining headlines, subtitles and digital images to communicate ideas or emotions
*  using Viewpoints to develop questions as they experiment with media technologies, such as, “What happens if I take a photo up close to the object, and how does it change as I move further away?”, “How can I change the meaning of this image by adding different text headings?”

### Creating and making {#creating-and-making}

##### AC9AMA2C01 {#ac9ama2c01}

use media languages and media technologies to construct representations

**Elaborations**
*  creating a story through a series of captioned or voice-over images or direct to camera footage; exploring composition through character creation using images, sounds, and/or animation; for example, claymation
*  selecting and editing images, sound and text to re-create the characters in well-known stories or songs, using Viewpoints to develop questions when making decisions about composition; for example, asking questions about use of elements and content such as, “What images will I keep or delete?”, “Which image interests me and why?”
*  capturing and sequencing images and text to create a media arts work, such as a comic book that retells familiar or traditional stories
*  producing and presenting a media arts work for a particular purpose; for example, creating an advertisement that recommends appropriate behaviour when using cameras
*  using features such as shot types in media arts works; for example, identifying long-shots, mid-shots and close-ups; discussing what the shots tell the audience about the story

### Presenting and performing {#presenting-and-performing}

##### AC9AMA2P01 {#ac9ama2p01}

share media arts works with audiences in informal settings

**Elaborations**
*  collecting and sharing class stories and presenting them in the form of a class news bulletin, with permission of the people involved and observing relevant protocols, such as obtaining permission to use cultural material that belongs to a collective or a cultural group rather than an individual
*  presenting a media arts work they have made to the class, a small group or their teacher, and explaining how they made it and what they enjoyed about making it
*  considering relationships that peers may have with their work when creating, rehearsing and recording a radio play, and seeking permission to share it with another class
*  exploring what permission means; for example, consulting relevant people such as cultural knowledge holders or using online safety resources, and deciding on a class set of rules for using and creating images, sounds and text in media arts works

## Achievement Standards {#achievement-standards}

### Learning area achievement standard {#learning-area-achievement-standard}
By the end of Year 2, students identify where they experience the arts. They describe where, why and/or how people across cultures, communities and/or other contexts experience the arts.
Students demonstrate arts practices and skills across arts subjects. They create arts works in a range of forms. They share their work in informal settings.

### Subject achievement standard {#subject-achievement-standard}
By the end of Year 2, students identify where they experience media arts. They describe where, why and/or how people across cultures, communities and/or other contexts experience media arts.
Students use media languages and media technologies to construct representations in media arts works. They share their work with audiences safely and in informal ways.
