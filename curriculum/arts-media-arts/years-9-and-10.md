# Media Arts - Years 9 and 10 {#media-arts-years-9-and-10}

## Level Description {#level-description}

In this band, learning in Media Arts continues to build on each student’s prior learning and experiences. Students learn in and through developing understanding and application of the Media Arts concepts: media technologies, representations, audiences, institutions, media languages and relationships. They use production processes in purposeful and creative ways and continue to develop their connection with and contribution to the world as artists and as audiences. They work individually and in collaboration with peers and teachers.

In this band, the focus is on students:

1.  exploring and responding to

*   ways in which media arts works from across cultures, times, places and/or other contexts communicate ideas, perspectives and/or meaning, and the relationships the works create between makers, audiences and/or institutions; for example, through analysis
*   ways media arts works created and/or distributed by First Nations Australians celebrate and challenges multiple perspectives of Australian identity

3.  developing practices and skills

*   building and extending creative practices for producing media arts using media languages (technical and symbolic codes and conventions) relevant to selected forms, genres and styles, and available technologies
*   building and extending critical practices by taking opportunities to reflect, evaluate or respond to their own work and/or the work of others; for example, documenting ideas and intentions for media productions, evaluating audience responses to media works (including their own work) or considering relationships

5.  creating (producing) media arts works using production processes in forms such as print, screen/moving image, audio and/or hybrid/trans-disciplinary forms
6.  presenting/screening/distributing media arts works they have produced to audiences, in informal and/or formal settings; for example, audiences that are known to the students and/or unfamiliar audiences.

investigate the ways that media artists use media arts concepts to construct representations in media arts works and practices across cultures, times, places and/or other contexts

**Elaborations**
*  analysing and evaluating the social, cultural and/or ethical implications of the changing nature of representations in media arts works over time; for example, deconstructing representations constructed at different times or in different places to compare the representations of gender in print, screen and/or interactive media, or deconstructing the representation of multiculturalism or youth in Australian television

*  evaluating relationships embedded within media practices and discussing how media arts works and institutions can influence or challenge media practices and audience perceptions

*  comparing and critiquing ways First Nations Australian media artists use their practice to celebrate and challenge perspectives about Australia's identity, and the multiple ways they communicate these perspectives

##### AC9AMA10D01 {#ac9ama10d01}

experiment with ways to construct representations that reflect ideas, perspectives and/or meaning, and/or use of media conventions, media languages and media technologies

**Elaborations**
*  examining the way technical and symbolic codes are shaped by a media artist such as a social media influencer, auteur, game designer or music video director, to inform their construction of representations; for example, using design, production and post-production processes to engage a target audience for a narrative music video or short film, social media product, or genre film such as a teen flick, thriller film or documentary
*  researching target audiences and conventions used in successful online media arts works and using the results of this research to design and produce a media arts work that communicates representations aimed at building relationships with and engaging an audience
*  experimenting with use of mise-en-scène, camera work, sound, editing and media technologies in ways that are typically used in a genre, auteur or film movement
*  manipulating technical and symbolic media codes and conventions of specific film, television or radio genres to produce a media arts work for a target audience; for example, creating a film trailer, film poster, short genre film or soundscape that communicates their understandings of the world around them

reflect on their own or others’ media arts works and/or practices to refine and inform choices they make during stages of the production process

**Elaborations**
*  developing skills needed to use selected media technologies to produce a photographic sequence for distribution in print, through an online photo gallery or a moving image media arts work, such as sequences or scenes using a DSLR camera, and developing understanding through reflective practice of how to use the manual settings for ISO, shutter speed and aperture for accurate exposure
*  identifying and developing knowledge and skills needed to produce a media arts work such as a computer game, community service announcement, website or music video, to develop audience awareness about a social or cultural issue
*  using Viewpoints to frame questions and explore possibilities by, for example, examining how camera work, sound, editing, media technologies and mise-en-scène have been manipulated to construct conventional representations of values, themes or ideas in a genre or body of work of an auteur or film movement or style; then safely, ethically, legally and responsibly designing, producing and editing a media arts work that communicates alternative representations to audiences

apply production processes and use media arts concepts to construct representations and produce media arts works that communicate ideas, perspectives and/or meaning, and confirm or challenge the expectations of specific audiences

**Elaborations**
