# Media Arts - Foundation Year {#media-arts-foundation-year}

## Level Description {#level-description}

In Foundation, learning in The Arts builds on the Early Years Learning Framework and each student’s prior learning and experiences. The curriculum allows for play-based approaches that integrate arts learning experiences across the 5 Arts subjects and/or specialist teaching. There are examples in the content elaborations for each subject and examples that span across the subjects.

In Foundation, Arts learning fosters students’ understanding of how the arts enrich their lives and the lives of all people. Engagement with the arts strengthens students’ sense of wellbeing and develops their connections with the world. Arts learning involves exploration and purposeful, creative play, together with structured learning appropriate for their level of development. In The Arts, students work individually and collaboratively with peers and teachers, drawing on their imaginations, stimulus materials such as images or works of fiction, and real-life experiences.

Students explore the arts in their lives and communities. They learn that the arts are central to all cultures and explore the diversity of arts works across cultures. They build empathy and understanding that what is familiar to one person can be new to somebody else. Students use arts knowledge and skills to make arts works that represent their ideas about the world and share their work with peers in informal settings. They experience being an audience. As they make and respond, students learn about safe practices in the arts.

In Foundation, learning in Media Arts can involve students:

*   using available technologies to capture and sequence images, sounds and text
*   learning to use available equipment such as cameras or materials for constructing print media
*   exploring ways to construct representations that communicate ideas and stories
*   discovering how they and others can use media to communicate feelings and understandings.

### Exploring and responding {#exploring-and-responding}

##### AC9AMAFE01 {#ac9amafe01}

explore how and why the arts are important for people and communities

**Elaborations**
*  exploring how facial expressions, gestures and other ways of moving, and using voice or language, can communicate emotions and feelings in arts works; for example, characters in portraits, cartoons, songs, chants or dances from different times and cultures
*  identifying and/or learning social or cultural dances that have meaning for people and communities, taking care to observe relevant protocols; for example, working with community representatives or using accredited resources
*  using dramatic play to explore ideas or understandings they observe or perceive in a text or image (print or screen); for example, exploring questions such as “What is happening?”, “What will happen next?”
*  identifying arts works and experiences in their lives, such as songs they sing, dances or drama they watch or perform, animations, computer games or music videos, public art, 2D, 3D or screen-based works they encounter at school or in community settings, and sharing ideas and feelings about the works with peers and teachers
*  singing songs that are used for celebrations, such as school songs, anthems, sports teams’ songs, birthday songs and songs that help teach content or concepts from other learning areas, such as health messages
*  exploring how illustrations/images in a text (fiction or non-fiction, print or screen) help to communicate narrative or information about characters or settings and/or mood
*  listening to First Nations Australians talk about the importance of the arts for connecting to people, culture and Country/Place; for example, using resources created or co-created by First Nations Australians

### Developing practices and skills {#developing-practices-and-skills}

##### AC9AMAFD01 {#ac9amafd01}

use play, imagination, arts knowledge, processes and/or skills to discover possibilities and develop ideas

**Elaborations**
*  playing with the tactile qualities of a range of materials (rough, smooth, spikey, gooey) and exploring how they feel about these qualities to develop ideas for a visual artwork, dance or soundscape; for example, using art materials, movement and/or voice to depict or embody the tactile qualities they have discovered; moving their body to communicate the smooth or rough qualities of a stone or ball
*  imagining how the characters in a story they are reading might dress or move, and making still or moving images to communicate ideas about the characters; for example, working in groups and using dramatic play to imagine possibilities about characters and situations or asking questions such as “What happens next?”
*  identifying and describing shapes, colours and lines they observe in their environment and exploring ways to use these shapes creatively; for example, imagining and trialling ways to use geometric and organic shapes and collage techniques to represent a familiar object such as a face; improvising movements that trace a series of shapes such as circle, rectangle and triangle; improvising a melody that follows the contour of the shape, or working collaboratively to form frozen or still images of each shape
*  playing games to develop subject-specific practices such as pitch, beat and/or rhythm recognition; exploring ways that body parts, zones and bases can be moved safely and expressively; taking on the point of view of a fictional character in dramatic play
*  responding to the emotions they experience while listening to different pieces of music and using movement to share their response; for example, using scarves and movement, or creating visual images using materials such as crayons or paint
*  improvising rhythmic patterns for clapping or stamping, or inventing new movements for familiar action songs, and interpreting these visually using elements of art/design such as shapes, lines and/or colours, and materials such as paper and pencil or string
*  exploring their speaking and singing voices and discovering ways they can use their voices/vocalisation to communicate ideas and feelings
*  improvising movements to explain the steps in a process, and then using a camera to capture a series of images/photographic story that can be displayed in the classroom to remind everybody about the process

### Creating and making {#creating-and-making}

##### AC9AMAFC01 {#ac9amafc01}

create arts works that communicate ideas

**Elaborations**
*  creating arts works in a range of forms to communicate ideas from lived personal or social experiences; for example, creating a dance or scenes showing favourite activities such as games; using digital devices to record their peers playing a game and creating a voice-over that describes what's happening; composing a song or chant about a favourite food or activity; drawing a home scene of people and animals
*  creating works in response to inspiration from sources such as play, imagination, observation, literature, artworks from their cultures and communities or arts knowledge and skill development activities
*  extending and varying known songs, chants or rhymes; for example, changing words, interpreting without using voice, adding movements/actions or improvising rhythm patterns as accompaniment
*  manipulating objects, puppets, 2D images and/or available technologies to create or retell stories
*  devising a chant/rap that a character from an animated series, a text or a fictional hero could use to communicate a health or sustainability message or to learn the steps in a process; recording the chant/rap using an available digital device and sharing live or via a school-managed space such as a learning management system
*  repurposing materials and objects such as clothing or packing boxes as starting points for imagining and developing scenes and scenarios; for example, using packing boxes to create an imagined environment or vehicle
*  considering as a class the characters and situations associated with a story and then re-imagining them by asking questions of the story, such as “What’s up?”, “What happens next?” or “What else might/could happen?" to support the development of their own socio-dramatic or miniature worlds play

### Presenting and performing {#presenting-and-performing}

##### AC9AMAFP01 {#ac9amafp01}

share their arts works with audiences

**Elaborations**
*  sharing their artworks with the class via a “gallery” or “performance walk”; for example, walking around the space looking at the works and using positive language to comment on the works and identify features such as similarities or differences, use of materials and elements of art/design, such as line
*  performing songs, soundscapes or chants/raps, using music skills they have learnt and practised, such as listening to and aiming to match starting pitch, staying in time with the group or following the agreed plan; for example, following a graphic score when performing a soundscape
*  taking images of class arts events (with permission from the people involved), creating an image sequence to document the occasion, and adding sound; for example, importing the images to a software program, sequencing the images, and using instruments and voices to create a soundscape to accompany the images
*  talking about ideas such as themes, processes used to make the work, or features of the work such as patterns, pathways or lines; for example, talking with the teacher and explaining the important features of their work
*  presenting retellings of stories to peers; for example, through dramatic play using repurposed objects, toys or puppets they have made
*  sharing their work with their teacher and responding to questions such as “What is going on in your work?”, “Tell me the story of what is happening?”, “What did you enjoy about making this work?”
*  performing movement/dance sequences they have created for other groups in their class and introducing their work by describing their favourite moments in the sequence or explaining why they chose a particular movement
*  using digital devices to record their arts explorations; for example, curating (selecting, ordering) a sequence of digital images (photos) to show the steps in a process; for example, images that show how they created new colours by mixing primary colours (using playdough or paint) and adding commentary that expresses their feelings, emotions and understandings
