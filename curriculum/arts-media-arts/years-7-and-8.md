# The Arts - Media Arts - Years 7 and 8

## Level Description

In this band, learning in Media Arts builds on each student’s prior learning and experiences. Students learn in and through developing understanding and application of the Media Arts concepts: media technologies, representation, audience, institutions, media languages and relationships. They use production processes in purposeful and creative ways and continue to develop their connection with and contribution to the world as artist and as audiences. They work individually and in collaboration with peers and teachers.

Students explore media arts in local, regional, national and global contexts such as media produced in countries or regions of Asia, and/or in multi-arts, trans-disciplinary or hybrid forms. They take opportunities to engage with living media arts practitioners and expand their awareness of diverse media arts practices, genres, styles and forms.

In this band, the focus is on students:

1.  exploring and responding to

*   media arts works, practices and contexts from across cultures, times, places and/or other contexts; for example, through analysis of their own media arts work or work associated with selected institutions
*   the diversity of media arts created by First Nations Australians and how this work demonstrates respect for Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property rights

3.  developing practices and skills

*   creative practices for producing media arts using media languages (technical and symbolic codes and conventions) relevant to selected forms and/or styles through available media technologies
*   critical practices by taking opportunities to reflect, evaluate or respond to their own work and/or the work of others; for example, documenting ideas and intentions for media productions, evaluating audience responses to media works (including their own work) and considering relationships

5.  create (producing) media arts works in forms such as print, screen/moving image, audio and/or hybrid-/trans-disciplinary forms using production processes
6.  presenting/screening/distributing media arts works they have produced to audiences; for example, for a specific target audience.

## Strands

### Exploring and responding

##### AC9AMA8E01

investigate the ways that media arts concepts are used in media arts works and practices across cultures, times, places and/or other contexts

**Elaborations**
*  identifying, describing and analysing how, for example, cinematography, mise-en-scène, editing or sound are manipulated to construct representations of people, place, events or ideologies
*  using questions to analyse the ideology or philosophical viewpoint of a media arts work, including what institutions were involved in its distribution, and its potential impact on audiences
*  analysing the way media languages are used to construct representations of people, places and concepts in media genres and products; for example, the ways that technical and symbolic codes are used to construct stereotypical representations of people, places or concepts in media arts works aimed at teenagers
*  analysing the way audiences are positioned to respond to different representations constructed by technical and symbolic codes in media arts works, such as in the depiction of cultural or social groups and values in Australian film and television

##### AC9AMA8E02

investigate the diversity of First Nations Australians’ media arts works and practices, considering culturally responsive approaches to Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property rights

**Elaborations**
*  exploring how knowledge of the ways protocols can be used to protect Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property rights can help students make ethical choices about how they use content for media arts works; for example, by asking questions such as, “Who created these images, sounds, texts?”, “May I use these ideas, and do I need permission to do so?”
*  investigating an example of cultural appropriation where it has been found that First Nations Australian Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property rights have been denied, and identifying how this situation could have been approached respectfully; for example, a situation where a media artist used images or music in a short film that carries cultural knowledge without permission from the knowledge holders
*  investigating choices First Nations Australian media artists make about use of technical and symbolic elements, use of story principles, construction of representations and relationships they seek to establish with audiences, respecting Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property rights
*  collaboratively constructing a set of guidelines to promote safe, ethical, legal and responsible media use; for example, guidelines that will assist decision-making about whether or not ideas from existing cultural expressions can be used when developing a new work
*  recognising how to select and use historical materials that accurately communicate First Nations Australians’ perspectives for including in media arts works, such as their resilience in response to the impacts of colonisation
*  investigating issues relating to use of First Nations Australian languages or stories in lyrics and songs for screen-based works; for example, considering case studies that illustrate protocols relating to Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property rights

### Developing practices and skills

##### AC9AMA8D01

develop media production skills throughout the production process to construct representations using media languages and media technologies

**Elaborations**
*  exploring ways to use media languages and media technologies to create representations that perpetuate or challenge relationships, or address issues such as stereotyping, bias, identity or sustainable ways of living
*  experimenting with the technical capabilities of media technologies and using media languages to inform plans for the design and construction of representations of people, places or concepts in media arts forms, such as print, moving image and interactive content
*  experimenting with digital tools such as cameras, sound recording equipment or editing/coding/animation software to construct representations of people, places or concepts for various genres or media platforms
*  constructing fictional versions of everyday spaces using augmented (AR) and virtual realities (VR); for example, interacting in AR and VR worlds and documenting their experiences, or using a green screen to “transport” students into different worlds
*  experimenting with audio effects such as sound effects, music or Foley sounds to construct ambient sound to enhance representations of different places in a media arts work
*  experimenting with established story principles, such as creating the opening scene to a documentary film that establishes a setting and location, or disrupting story principles through the manipulation of time so the narrative structure is not as an audience would expect
*  combining established genre conventions to make a hybrid production; for example, exploring established media forms such as narrative, non-narrative, experimental, micro-documentary, trailers, music video, micro-short film and social media video campaign, or genres such as horror, western or comedy

##### AC9AMA8D02

reflect on their own and others’ media arts works and practices to inform choices they make during the production process

**Elaborations**
*  observing and considering potential audience engagement to inform refinements across pre-production, production, post-production and/or distribution processes
*  using Viewpoints to develop investigating questions when making decisions about how to represent a theme, concept or idea, and considering media conventions
*  documenting and explaining their creative choices in relation to representations, genre codes and conventions
*  justifying decisions made by producers in the construction of representations of people, places or concepts through the use of technical and symbolic codes, and how producers benefit from this construction
*  using a storyboarding or editing template to annotate their creative thinking when refining production processes
*  using Viewpoints to develop reflective questions such as “How can I represent a range of views about this issue in my media arts work?”, “What do I need to change in the production processes to create a stronger connection with the audience?”
*  exploring styles and representations particular to a country or region to inform their own practice and to develop their understanding of cultural appropriation and representation; for example, exploring the use of media conventions and languages in cartooning genres in Asia.

### Creating and making

##### AC9AMA8C01

design and structure media arts works to communicate ideas, perspectives and meaning for an intended audience

**Elaborations**
*  using pre-production templates such as a storyboard, shooting script or production schedule to plan production
*  understanding the importance of, and applying, respectful relationships and empathy when developing characters to convey historical or cultural ideas and meaning; for example, planning how to create relationships with audiences when developing characters
*  exploring ways to use media languages and technologies to create representations that perpetuate or challenge relationships, or address issues such as stereotyping, bias, identity and sustainable ways of living, in media arts forms such as cartoons, graphic/print, photographic sequences and moving image
*  experimenting with the technical capabilities of media technologies and using media languages to inform plans for the design and construction of representations of people, places or concepts
*  experimenting with ways to use technical and symbolic elements such as sound and lighting to construct representations of people, places and concepts for various genres or media platforms
*  experimenting with audio, including sound effects, music and Foley sounds, to construct ambient sound for different places or to create/enhance an atmosphere
*  experimenting with technical and symbolic elements to construct safe, legal, ethical and responsible representations of cultural or social groups and values
*  trialling ways to combine established genre conventions to make a hybrid production; for example, exploring genres such as narrative, non-narrative, experimental, micro-documentary, trailer, music video, micro-short film and social media video campaign

##### AC9AMA8C02

apply production processes and use media arts concepts to construct representations and produce media arts works that communicate ideas, perspectives and/or meaning for specific audiences using responsible media practice

**Elaborations**
*  using pre-production, production and post-production processes to produce a media arts work that represents ways of adapting habits or customs to build a more sustainable future for their community or to highlight how people are engaging in online social justice campaigns to contribute to a just and equal society
*  combining established genre conventions such as framing in still and moving images; sounds in radio plays, or podcasts and audio-visual artworks; and font size, shape and colour in print
*  transferring established technical codes between media types, such as framing in still and moving images; sounds in radio plays or podcasts and audio-visual artworks; and font size, shape and colour in print; for example, a low angle shot of a person makes us think they have high status in both still and moving images, or interludes may be used in radio plays and/or podcasts
*  using Viewpoints to ask questions relating to forms and elements; for example, “What elements define a genre?”, “How can I create mood and setting through images/sound/framing?”
*  producing a media arts work that represents ways of adapting habits or customs to build a more sustainable future for their community or to highlight how people are changing their behaviours to contribute to a just and equal society
*  creating a news story in a print or digital format, focusing on an event they have been involved in, to communicate a perspective, using media languages to persuade their audience, and employing questions based on Viewpoints to consider how to manipulate aspects of the production for bias; for example, “Do the stories leave out or emphasise information?” or “Do the stories present the audience with obvious heroes and villains?” and “Why would media institutions engage in these practices?”

### Presenting and performing

##### AC9AMA8P01

present media arts works, using responsible media practices and considering potential relationships the work could create with audiences

**Elaborations**
*  distributing a media arts work designed to engage a specific audience and using appropriate rights and permissions to upload to an online space, such as a closed platform controlled by their school; for example, distributing a music video they have made for a specific audience
*  complying with copyright laws and respecting Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property rights when presenting media arts works; for example, obtaining permission to use cultural material that belongs to a collective or a cultural group rather than an individual
*  reflecting on how relationships develop between media arts makers and their audiences, or across cohorts within the audience group, when planning when and how to present a media arts work they have made to an audience
*  considering the impact of different audiences on the interpretation of and engagement with their media arts works; for example, presenting their media arts works in different contexts and evaluating the effectiveness of the response, such as using a school learning management platform to share work online with the school community, or sharing work at a fixed time and place such as a school exhibition

## Achievement Standards

By the end of year 8, students analyse the use of media arts concepts to construct representations that communicate ideas, perspectives and/or meaning in media arts works they produce and/or experience. They evaluate use of media arts concepts in media arts works from across cultures, times, places and/or other contexts. They describe respectful approaches to creating and/or responding to media arts works.

 Students select and manipulate media languages, media technologies and use production processes to construct representations. They create media arts works that communicate ideas, perspectives and/or meanings. They present their work to an audience. They plan where and how they could distribute their work using responsible media practice.
