# The Arts - Media Arts - Years 3 and 4

## Level Description

In this band, learning in The Arts builds on each student’s prior learning and experiences. Arts learning in this band continues to use purposeful and creative play-based activities that foster development of students’ identity and wellbeing, and their connection with and contribution to the world. Students further develop their capability and confidence in using subject-specific skills and creative and critical practices. They work individually and in collaboration with peers and teachers.

Students continue to explore media arts works that they experience at home, school or through family and community events. They connect with media artists who live and work in the community; for example, by visiting arts spaces or exploring media arts and experiences such as in-person or online screenings, exhibitions and presentations. They use stimulus materials such as images, events, texts, questions and observations as inspiration for their own media arts works. These experiences support students to develop aesthetic knowledge across cognitive, sensory, emotive and physical domains, and to value arts works and practices across cultures, times, places and/or other contexts such as countries or cultures in Asia.

In this band, the focus is on students:

1.  exploring and responding to

*   works and experiences that showcase where, why and how media is created and used across cultures, times, places and/or other contexts
*   examples of media arts created by First Nations Australians that communicate connection to and responsibility for Country/Place

3.  developing critical and creative practices and skills

*   creative practices for using media arts concepts, visual, audio and/or interactive elements to construct representations
*   critical practices for observing, reflecting on and responding to media they experience, including their own media arts works

5.  creating (producing) media arts works in a range of forms to communicate ideas to audiences using media technologies and media languages
6.  presenting media arts works they have created in informal settings such as spaces within the school.

### Exploring and responding

##### AC9AMA4E01

explore where, why and how media arts is created and/or distributed across cultures, times, places and/or other contexts

**Elaborations**
*  sequencing images, sounds and/or text to clearly establish the beginning, middle and end of a story or event; for example, taking a series of photographs or a short film sequence that represents comic superheroes and villains through setting, costume and body language
*  identifying meaning and describing representations in media arts works from different social, cultural or historical contexts; for example, examining the different ways traditional stories are retold using media technologies or the use of stereotypes in advertising
*  comparing media arts works made for different purposes using appropriate language, and identifying features such as use of conventions in a variety of media types
*  using appropriate language to discuss the meaning of their own media arts works; for example, in writing or through an oral, visual or multimedia presentation
*  investigating digital or analog storyboarding as a planning tool; for example, preparing a storyboard for a short film, stop motion or comic strip, to create a sequence of actions, changes or events; rearranging the sequence of boards, or adding and removing boards, to change the meaning or add new meaning to the narrative, and testing how a group of people responds

##### AC9AMA4E02

explore how First Nations Australians use media arts to communicate their connection to and responsibility for Country/Place

**Elaborations**
*  identifying meaning and describing representations in media arts works created and/or co-created by First Nations Australians, such as how traditional stories of First Nations Australians are being retold using media technologies and media arts concepts; for example, through animation, stop motion or green screen
*  recognising, through media arts, how First Nations Australians’ cultural expressions often contain and communicate connection to and responsibility for Country/Place, such as naming the Country and Traditional Owners, showing respect to the Traditional Owners and acknowledging their Ancestors, and the land, sea, sky and waterways, singing and/or speaking in language
*  exploring First Nations Australians’ use of media arts to express connection to and responsibility for Country/Place, such as communicating knowledge about the local seasons or using screen-based storytelling to maintain language and unique ways of life
*  exploring how First Nations Australians use media arts concepts to communicate their connection to and responsibility for Country/Place, such as use of media languages, media technologies or relationships; for example, learning about the diverse use of languages, symbols and icons
*  collecting and sharing information about media arts works created and produced by First Nations Australians for occasions such as festivals or ceremonies, and reflecting on how these media arts works can communicate important information or knowledge about Country/Place
*  exploring how stories and ideas can communicate connection to and responsibility for Country/Place; for example, cultural stories of cyclic phenomena, knowledge of land, sea, sky and waterways, how First Nations Australians perceive themselves and their environment
*  exploring a media arts work that includes images, sound and/or text and communicates the diversity of First Nations Australians’ cultures, such as an interactive map of First Nations Australian languages, considering, for example, how media technologies and languages are used to communicate and create a relationship with the viewer

### Developing practices and skills

##### AC9AMA4D01

develop media production skills by exploring ways of shaping ideas using media technologies, images, sounds, text and/or interactive elements

**Elaborations**
*  experimenting with suspense to create meaning and sustain representations; for example, exploring the way colour, shot type and editing techniques are used to communicate film genre
*  investigating how the conventions of a news story or video game communicate meaning; for example, examining the different ways speech bubble text can be written and how it can reflect the way a character is speaking
*  exploring different ways of creating sounds when making a soundscape; for example, creating Foley sounds with available resources, such as rustling plastic for the sound of fire or using different types of shoes and surfaces to create a variety of footstep sounds
*  exploring media technologies and languages when creating sound effects or images to convey a mood or main idea of a story; for example, reviewing captured images, storyboarding, zooming in and out, deleting unwanted images, adding sound/text to images to create or support a story, considering how different options might be perceived by the intended audience
*  using Viewpoints to develop questions to respond to their experiences as they work, such as, “In what ways does the meaning of the image change when I manipulate the sound effects?”, “Where is the suspense happening in this work, and how do I know?”, “Which images will best represent the story I am trying to tell?”

### Creating and making

##### AC9AMA4C01

use media languages, media technologies and production processes to construct representations that communicate ideas, perspectives and/or meaning

**Elaborations**
*  taking a series of photographs that show themselves and their friends as comic superheroes and villains through setting, costume and body language, and using questions based on Viewpoints relating to forms and elements; for example, “What images will I use and in what order?”
*  creating a soundscape to accompany a moving image that includes Foley sounds and recorded sounds on a variety of devices to explore volume, layering and the use of voice to create a sense of environment
*  using learning from explorations of media arts works that communicate First Nations Australians’ connection to and responsibility for Country/Place to devise media arts works that communicate their own connection to and responsibility for place; for example, creating a short film that communicates their feelings about a “favourite” place or shows how they care for a place in their community
*  experimenting with the camera and framing the subject, using shot types, angles and lighting, and experimenting to apply text to still or moving images, such as credits in a title sequence
*  filming a short sequence that focuses on conflict by selecting camera angles, lighting and/or costume to convey meaning without dialogue
*  collaborating with others to make a small publication to explore ideas that are significant in their lives; for example, a zine or new website, using collaged images and texts and drawings

### Presenting and performing

##### AC9AMA4P01

share media arts works in informal settings considering responsible media practice

**Elaborations**
*  creating credits in a title sequence and selecting appropriate fonts, colour and length of display time to accompany screening of a series of moving images that the class has created
*  seeking permission to take photos of class members; for example, documenting a school excursion for publication on the school intranet and acknowledging that this permission has been obtained when sharing the work
*  considering media concepts, such as audience and relationships, when formatting and laying out a story, using available software and appropriate text conventions for a front-page news story or print advertisement

## Achievement Standards

By the end of Year 4, students describe the use of media languages and media technologies to construct representations in media arts works they experience and/or produce. They describe where, why and/or how media arts works are created and/or distributed across cultures, times, places, and/or other contexts.

Students use media languages, and media technologies and production processes to construct representations in media arts works. They share their work in informal settings using responsible media practice.
