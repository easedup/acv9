# Media Arts - Years 5 and 6 {#media-arts-years-5-and-6}

## Level Description {#level-description}

In this band, students continue to learn in and through the practices of The Arts subjects, building on their prior learning and experiences. They work creatively and purposefully, and continue to develop their connection with and contribution to the world as artists and as audiences. They work individually and in collaboration with peers and teachers.

Students engage with media arts works, artists and practices across cultures, times, places and/or other contexts; for example, exploring arts works and practices in their local area, state/territory and/or a country or region of Asia. They take opportunities to engage with living media artists and their works; for example, by exploring media arts works and experiences such as in-person or online exhibitions, presentations and screenings. They continue to use stimulus materials, such as images, events, texts, questions and observations, as inspiration for their own media arts works. These experiences support students to develop aesthetic knowledge across cognitive, sensory, emotive and physical domains and to value media arts works and practices from diverse cultures.

In this band, the focus is on students:

1.  exploring and responding to

*   media from local, regional, national and global cultures, times, places and/or other contexts that show ways media arts works can be used to communicate ideas, perspectives and/or meaning, and engage audiences
*   media arts works that showcase ways First Nations Australians are continuing and revitalising cultures

3.  developing critical and creative practices and skills

*   creative practices, using media technologies and media languages
*   critical practices by observing, reflecting on and responding to media they experience (including their own media arts works)

5.  creating (producing) media arts works that communicate ideas using stand-alone media arts forms or creating media elements for use in multi-arts works
6.  presenting/screening/exhibiting/distributing media arts works they have created and sharing ideas about the work with audiences.

## Strands {#strands}

### Exploring and responding {#exploring-and-responding}

##### AC9AMA6E01 {#ac9ama6e01}

explore ways that media languages and media technologies are used in media arts works and practices across cultures, times, places and/or other contexts

**Elaborations**
*  investigating characters in games, considering issues such as stereotyping or bias as background to designing and drawing a game character for a particular genre, and considering the appropriate costume, cultural background and/or sample dialogue
*  exploring status, such as power relationships, and showing different perspectives of character by using framing, colour and costume to create a hero or villain character
*  using Viewpoints to develop questions that explore the impact of media technologies on the way the audience experiences a story in media arts; for example, “How can I change the meaning of a story by changing or adding a soundtrack to my images?”, “How can I use framing to demonstrate a power relationship between characters in the story?”
*  researching and comparing media representations created in different times and places, and explaining how context influences the characters, stories and values portrayed in media arts works; for example, comparing TV representations of family
*  using Viewpoints to develop questions to explore new ideas; for example, “How are values demonstrated in this media representation?”, “Can we judge a culture from popular media images?”
*  exploring how context influences the characters, stories and values portrayed in media arts works; for example, comparing online advertisements that convey safety messages
*  discussing the role of media arts works in sharing cultural information about a group of people and their spirituality, and enhancing the value placed on people and the environment

##### AC9AMA6E02 {#ac9ama6e02}

explore ways First Nations Australians use media arts to continue and revitalise cultures

**Elaborations**
*  exploring (for example, by talking with First Nations Australians or accessing published resources accredited by First Nations Australian organisations) how and why cultural expressions and media arts works are critical for sharing, maintaining, continuing and revitalising cultures
*  identifying examples that illustrate how cultural expressions change over time; for example, by using available resources published by First Nations Australian communities and organisations
*  investigating the ways that First Nations Australian media artists embed themselves and their communities in media arts works in a range of representative forms as a visual declaration of identity, storytelling and resilience in the form of visibility; for example, exploring representations of First Nations Australians as superheroes in comics, popular culture and television
*  using Viewpoints to develop questions that explore understandings about themes or issues in media arts works and considering what needs to be investigated further; for example, “What do I already know about this issue?”, “Is there more to this story than is being presented?”, “What questions would I ask the media artist about this product?”

### Developing practices and skills {#developing-practices-and-skills}

##### AC9AMA6D01 {#ac9ama6d01}

develop media production skills to communicate ideas, perspectives and/or meaning through manipulation of media languages, including images, sounds, texts and/or interactive elements, and media technologies

**Elaborations**
*  experimenting with approaches to capturing and sequencing images and text to create comic books, animations or stop motion videos that retell familiar stories; for example, using green screen to explore a range of places
*  trialling options for applying the conventions of an established genre to an ordinary everyday event in order to create humour; for example, a visit to the library as an action movie, or exploring social relationships by framing images, and/or using music or sound effects to change the meaning or mood of a story, using augmented reality, virtual reality or chroma key to change an environment and convey new meaning
*  using Viewpoints to develop questions when solving problems or making decisions about preferred options; for example, “How can I change the meaning of a story by adding or modifying a soundtrack to my images?”
*  identifying story structures and technical or symbolic elements that contribute to the formation of genre in media arts works; for example, identifying shot type, sound quality, lighting and setting, and experimenting with ways to use this when planning media arts works
*  creating a script for a radio production and documenting the appropriate permissions that may be required for music and voice talents in a real-world community radio setting

### Creating and making {#creating-and-making}

##### AC9AMA6C01 {#ac9ama6c01}

use media languages, media technologies and production processes to construct media arts works that communicate ideas, perspectives and/or meaning for specific audiences

**Elaborations**
*  producing a media arts work for a particular purpose; for example, creating an advertisement for a new toy or computer game
*  designing a storyboard that reflects a key scene in a sequence; for example, storyboarding an opening scene of a film that shows the important camera angles, transitions, edits, voice and soundtrack
*  designing and drawing a game character for a particular genre and considering the appropriate costume, mannerisms and typical dialogue with a consideration for the relationships people can have with video games
*  designing a navigational plan for a game using multiple levels and obstacles; for example, creating and designing problems that need to be solved before progressing to a new level
*  considering the codes and conventions of music videos to create their own section of a music video that brings together their learning in music, dance and media arts
*  creating a short genre film using chroma key, special effects, editing, sound effects, film language and other technology to enhance the end product
*  using Viewpoints to develop questions when reflecting on their production process, such as “How can I adapt and manipulate story principles to make my intention clear?”, “What is working well in my storyboard?” and “Which areas do I need to improve?”

### Presenting and performing {#presenting-and-performing}

##### AC9AMA6P01 {#ac9ama6p01}

present media arts works in informal and/or formal settings using responsible media practice

**Elaborations**
*  applying responsible media practices relating to the media arts works they are creating, such as legal, ethical and moral considerations
*  presenting a short film they have created to different audiences on different platforms, such as in an informal setting in the classroom and in a formal setting such as a school assembly, and reflecting on how and why their work may or may not have been received differently to their intention
*  presenting their media arts works using internet-based media technologies; for example, on curated digital platforms, such as school learning management systems, while considering responsible media practice and online safety, and engaging with audience responses
*  considering protocols for representing community or cultural stories in media arts works
*  reflecting on how and why understandings of culture were used within their media arts works, and their effect on the audience
