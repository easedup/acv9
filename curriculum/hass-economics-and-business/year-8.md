# Economics and Business - Year 8 {#economics-and-business-year-8}

## Level Description {#level-description}

The focus of learning in Year 8 is the topic **"Australian markets"** within a national context.

Students investigate a range of factors that influence decision-making by individuals and business. These include the allocation of resources to produce goods and services in the operation of markets, and the different ways that businesses may adapt to opportunities in markets or respond to the changing nature of work.

Students also examine the influences on decision-making within consumer and financial contexts through a focus on the role of Australia’s system of taxation, particularly in relation to spending by individuals and businesses, support for the common good, and the importance of goal-setting, budgeting and planning.

Inquiry questions provide a framework for developing students’ knowledge, understanding and skills. The following inquiry questions are examples only and may be used or adapted to suit local contexts:

*   How do markets influence decision-making about the allocation of resources to the production of goods and services?
*   How do businesses develop or adapt to opportunities in the market and changes in the workplace?
*   What is the role of Australia’s taxation system and how does it support individuals and business?
*   Why are financial planning and budgeting important processes for individuals and businesses?

### Knowledge and understanding {#knowledge-and-understanding}

##### AC9HE8K01 {#ac9he8k01}

how markets influence decisions about the allocation of resources to the production of goods and services, and the effect of prices on these decisions

**Elaborations**
*  identifying who is involved in the market system in Australia and explaining how the market operates through the interactions of participants (household, business, finance and government sectors)
*  explaining how interaction between buyers and sellers enables the allocation of resources to the production of goods and services; that is, “What to produce?”, “How to produce?” and “For whom to produce?”

*  explaining how price is the means by which the decisions of consumers and businesses interact to determine the allocation of resources; for example, when the price of a good or service rises, resources are redirected to produce additional goods and services

##### AC9HE8K02 {#ac9he8k02}

different ways that businesses adapt to opportunities in the market and respond to the changing nature of work

**Elaborations**
*  discussing how businesses identify needs, niches and gaps in established markets to guide the development of specific services or products to address these opportunities; for example, electric cars and solar power
*  identifying where businesses have used technologies to streamline or gain efficiencies in existing business models; for example, ride share, food delivery applications and online retail
*  explaining current influences on the ways people work; for example, technological change, outsourced labour in the global economy, rapid communication changes, casualisation of the workforce
*  identifying and explaining changes to the workforce over time; for example, the jobs available, the way individuals or businesses value particular work, career length and human resource development, changing demography, corporate social responsibility, sustainability practices, changes to workplace laws

how First Nations Australian businesses and entrepreneurs develop opportunities in the market

**Elaborations**
*  investigating how First Nations Australian businesses and entrepreneurs establish partnerships or cooperatives to provide goods and services such as farming, fashion, design or tourism

*  investigating how First Nations Australian businesses and entrepreneurs use connection to, and responsibility for, Country/Place to make innovations in the production and distribution of goods and services; for example, medicines and food derived from the environment or cultural tourism

##### AC9HE8K04 {#ac9he8k04}

the importance of Australia’s system of taxation and how this system affects decision-making by individuals and businesses

**Elaborations**

*  identifying the rights and obligations of individuals in relation to taxation by asking questions such as, “When should I apply for a tax file number?”, “How is income tax calculated?”, “What should I do when an employer is not deducting the right amount of tax?” and “How do I lodge a tax return?”
*  identifying examples of taxes paid by individuals and businesses, and explaining how they may influence decision-making about spending; for example, the effect of income tax, import duties or excise duties on price of goods and services
*  explaining how the collection of taxes and the provision of services supports individual human and financial wellbeing, communities and Australian society

##### AC9HE8K05 {#ac9he8k05}

processes that individuals and/or businesses use to plan and budget to achieve short-term and long-term financial objectives

##### AC9HE8S01 {#ac9he8s01}

develop questions to investigate a contemporary economic and business issue

**Elaborations**
*  developing a range of questions to form the basis of an investigation; for example, “Why does an individual or group establish a business?” and “How are consumers’ rights protected?”
*  developing targeted or key questions using economics and business concepts and terms, such as, “How is the price of goods and services determined?” and “Why do changes in market price act as a signal about how scarce resources should be allocated?”

##### AC9HE8S02 {#ac9he8s02}

locate, select and organise information and data from a range of sources

**Elaborations**
