# Economics and Business - Year 7 {#economics-and-business-year-7}

## Level Description {#level-description}

The focus of learning in Year 7 is the topic **"individuals, businesses and entrepreneurs"** within a personal, community and national context.

In Year 7, students investigate the nature and purpose of informed and responsible decision-making by individuals and businesses, with attention to the allocation of limited resources to meet unlimited needs and wants, types of businesses, how entrepreneurial characteristics contribute to business success, and the ways work is undertaken. They also examine the rights and responsibilities that individuals and businesses have within consumer and financial contexts.

Inquiry questions provide a framework for developing students’ knowledge, understanding and skills. The following inquiry questions are examples only and may be used or adapted to suit local contexts:

*   How and why are economic decisions made to allocate limited resources to meet unlimited needs and wants in the Australian economy?
*   What are the different types of businesses that provide goods and/or services?
*   What is entrepreneurship and how do entrepreneurial characteristics contribute to the success of a business?
*   Why do individuals contribute to their community and how do they derive an income?
*   Why do consumers and businesses have both rights and responsibilities?
