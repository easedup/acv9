# Humanities and Social Sciences - Economics and Business 7-10 - Year 9

## Level Description

The focus of learning in Year 9 is the topic **"international trade and interdependence"** within a global context, including trade with the countries of Asia.

Students investigate what it means for Australia to be part of the global economy, particularly through trade with the countries of Asia and the influence on the allocation of resources, and how businesses create and maintain competitive advantage. They examine the implications of interdependence of participants in the global economy for decision-making.

Students focus on consumer and financial risks and rewards. They examine the influence of Australia’s financial sector on economic decision-making for how it contributes to a prosperous economy and responds to challenges impacting on peoples’ lives and choices.

Inquiry questions provide a framework for developing students’ knowledge, understanding and skills. The following inquiry questions are examples only and may be used or adapted to suit local contexts:

*   Why does Australia trade with other nations?
*   How do participants in the global economy interact?
*   What is the role of the financial sector in the Australian economy?
