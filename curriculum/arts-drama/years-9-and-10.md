# Drama - Years 9 and 10 {#drama-years-9-and-10}

## Level Description {#level-description}

In this band, learning in Drama continues to build on each student’s prior learning and experiences as students develop their capability and confidence across the practices of Drama: creating, performing and responding. They continue to use drama processes in purposeful and creative ways that are informed by their engagement with the work of living performers and drama-makers from across local, regional, national and global contexts, such as countries or regions in Asia, including use of drama in multi-arts, trans-disciplinary and/or hybrid forms. This awareness of diverse drama practices, genres and/or styles informs their own drama practice. They work collaboratively with peers and teachers.

In this band, the focus is on students:

1.  exploring and responding to

*   drama works, performances, practices and contexts from a range of cultures, times and places; for example through analysis of their own drama or the work of others, including professional work
*   ways in which drama created and/or performed by First Nations Australians celebrates and challenges multiple perspectives of Australian identity

3.  developing practices and skills

*   building and extending creative practices for creating and performing drama using the elements of drama: role, situation, language, place, movement, time, character, relationships, voice, tension, space, mood/atmosphere, contrast, symbol, focus and conventions relevant to selected forms and/or styles
*   building and extending critical practices by taking opportunities to reflect on, evaluate or respond to their own work and the work of others; for example, documenting ideas and intentions for script interpretations, analysing their own and others’ use of elements of drama, and evaluating their own performances

5.  creating drama in improvised, devised and scripted forms such as process drama, puppetry, object theatre, short- or long-form improvisation, play building and devising, scripted drama/script interpretation; for example, interpretation of realism and non-realism, exploration of historic, contemporary and/or hybrid styles
6.  presenting and performing drama in informal and/or formal settings; for example, using acting skills and working in an ensemble to perform drama for familiar and unfamiliar audiences.

## Strands {#strands}

### Exploring and responding {#exploring-and-responding}

##### AC9ADR10E01 {#ac9adr10e01}

investigate use of elements of drama, performance skills and/or conventions to communicate and/or challenge ideas, perspectives and/or meaning in drama across cultures, times, places and/or other contexts

**Elaborations**
*  viewing a performance and considering how aspects of the dramatic action use elements of drama, such as symbol or movement, to make meaning; for example, a suitcase as a symbol for a person’s memories
*  investigating ways drama texts can be created and developed collaboratively to create; then reading a text to notice meaning/s created and intentions achieved through selection and combination of elements, conventions or styles
*  viewing examples of a variety of styles or forms within a style, such as historical and modern comedy forms and styles from Australia or Asia, or work that reflects “global culture”, to identify and understand how various conventions are shared and how they differ across the styles; then discussing which might be their preferred style
*  using Viewpoints to ask questions that consider contexts; for example, considering drama created in countries or regions in Asia or through collaboration between drama-makers in Asia and Australia, and considering questions such as “How does the drama relate to the social context in which it was created?”, “What cultural movements are evident in this drama?”, “What historical influences have impacted on this drama?”, “What is the actor–audience relationship in different dramatic contexts, forms and styles?”
*  viewing or reading and exploring examples of historical texts and styles from a range of cultural traditions where artists have used the conventions of contemporary performance, such as mediatisation or intertextuality, or styles such as physical theatre, non-realist or emerging/innovative forms, to affect meaning and for various purposes; then unpacking this as a foundation for their own creative process
*  identifying conventions of a collaborative, improvised style to communicate ideas or intentions to audiences; for example, to satirise or to elicit change; then considering how they, as artists, could use these creative tools for their own purposes

##### AC9ADR10E02 {#ac9adr10e02}

investigate the ways that drama created and/or performed by First Nations Australians celebrates and challenges multiple perspectives of Australian identity

**Elaborations**
*  investigating and researching specific examples of how and why drama practitioners work collaboratively with communities to develop and present contemporary First Nations Australian theatre
*  considering how global trends in drama are influencing drama created and/or performed by First Nations Australians
*  investigating specific examples of how Contemporary First Nations Australian Theatre explores and challenges concepts and histories of Australia and Australian identity
*  comparing and critiquing ways in which contemporary drama and cultural expressions celebrate and challenge influences on Australia's identity

### Developing practices and skills {#developing-practices-and-skills}

##### AC9ADR10D01 {#ac9adr10d01}

develop performance skills and/or techniques to manipulate elements of drama and/or use conventions to communicate the physical and psychological aspects of roles and characters consistent with intentions

**Elaborations**
*  experimenting with, reflecting on and refining the use of styles and conventions that have been explored in class in order to shape action; for example, considering how contemporary performance, non-realistic or innovative conventions can be used to re-shape or make a new meaning for a scene from a classic text; then workshopping the conventions and forms of comedy and shaping them into a short scene or applying them to a short piece of text
*  using analysis of examined text and performances to provide information for exploring and refining the implied or underlying aspects of character and dramatic action in a text or devised action
*  refining their skills of voice/vocalisation through warm-ups or exercises focusing on character and delivery or movement

##### AC9ADR10D02 {#ac9adr10d02}

reflect on their own and others’ drama or practices to refine and inform their use of elements of drama, conventions and/or approaches to shape and sustain dramatic action

**Elaborations**
*  comparing use of conventions to explore and challenge power and oppression in a range of performance styles
*  analysing and making choices about how to manipulate elements of drama and experimenting with the application of conventions, such as subtext or beats, to affect meaning, focus action or shape a scene
*  shaping their use of elements of drama, conventions and styles to achieve an intended meaning or effect

### Creating and making {#creating-and-making}

##### AC9ADR10C01 {#ac9adr10c01}

improvise and devise drama, and interpret scripted drama, using elements of drama and conventions to shape and manipulate dramatic action and convey intended ideas, perspectives and/or meaning

**Elaborations**
*  using a teacher-provided framework such as stimulus material (imagery, text, questions, form/style, conventions, character list, narrative outline) and working collaboratively to devise drama in response to the framework; for example, drama that explores a theme such as solidarity, “my place”, or responds to issues identified from another learning area
*  considering contexts such as audiences, viewpoints, intentions or purposes, style/form, as part of planning interpretations of scripted drama
*  conveying the tensions in stories, ideas, characters, relationships, actions and dialogue through manipulation of elements of drama, such as language, movement and symbol, to engage audiences and elicit responses
*  devising drama that presents a range of perspectives or responses to an event, question or situation; for example, presenting the same story from the perspective of different characters, using non-linear structures or conventions such as narrator/chorus, or introducing a new character to disrupt “agreed” understandings
*  scripting scenes initially developed through improvisation or process drama and using play-building techniques to develop the scenes; for example, scenes for a music theatre work
*  considering use of props, set items or digital tools to enhance communication of meaning in their drama

##### AC9ADR10C02 {#ac9adr10c02}

rehearse and refine drama making deliberate aesthetic choices to unify dramatic meaning

**Elaborations**
*  evaluating how ideas, emotions and audience response can be used to refine the drama or their use of performance skills
*  reflecting on and evaluating how successfully their intentions/purposes, clear action and meaning, and effects were achieved in context, through use of the elements, conventions, performance skills and/or design, and deciding what can be learnt from this for future dramatic practice

perform improvised, devised and/or scripted drama to audiences, using performance skills and conventions to shape the drama.

**Elaborations**
*  conveying, through voice/vocalisation and movement and use of symbol, the tensions in stories, ideas, characters, relationships, actions and dialogue in order to engage audiences and elicit responses
*  presenting and performing devised or scripted drama created in a shared process with community members, taking care to adhere to protocols such as recognising ownership of material by a collective or cultural group rather than by an individual
*  performing on stage or in class in a sustained presentation
*  reflecting on and evaluating how successfully their intentions/purposes, clear action and meaning, and effects were achieved in context, through use of the elements, conventions, performance skills and design, and what can be learnt from this for future dramatic practice

## Achievement Standards {#achievement-standards}

By the end of Year 10, students analyse how and why the elements of drama, performance skills and/or conventions are manipulated in drama they create, perform and/or experience. They evaluate how drama in a range of styles and/or from a range of contexts communicates ideas, perspectives and/or meaning. They evaluate how drama is used to celebrate and challenge perspectives of Australian identity.
Students work individually and/or collaboratively to shape and manipulate use of the elements of drama, conventions and/or dramatic structures to communicate ideas, perspectives and/or meaning. They use performance skills relevant to style and/or form to sustain belief, roles and characters in performances of improvised, devised and/or scripted drama for audiences.
