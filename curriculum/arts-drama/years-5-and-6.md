# The Arts - Drama - Years 5 and 6

## Level Description

In this band, students continue to learn in and through the practices of The Arts subjects, building on their prior learning and experiences. They use play and imagination in purposeful and creative ways and continue to develop their connection with and contribution to the world as artist and as audience. They work individually and in collaboration with peers and teachers.

Students engage with drama and drama practices across cultures, times, places and/or other contexts; for example, exploring drama in their local area, state/territory, and/or a country or region of Asia. They connect with people living and working in the community who create and/or perform drama; for example, by experiencing live and/or virtual performances. They continue to use stimulus materials such as images, events, texts, questions and/or observations as inspiration for their drama. These experiences support students to develop aesthetic knowledge across cognitive, sensory, emotive and physical domains, and to value arts works and practices from diverse cultures.

In this band, the focus is on students:

1.  exploring and responding to

*   drama from local, regional and global cultures, times, places and/or other contexts that shows how drama can be used to communicate ideas, perspectives and/or meaning
*   drama that showcases ways First Nations Australians are continuing and revitalising cultures

3.  developing creative and critical practices and skills

*   creative practices for creating and performing drama using elements of drama such as role, situation, language, place, movement, character, relationships, voice, time, tension, space, focus, contrast, mood/atmosphere and/or symbol
*   critical practices such as observing, reflecting on and responding to drama they experience, including their own drama

5.  creating drama in improvised, devised and scripted forms such as process drama, puppetry, improvisation, Readers’ Theatre, mime and movement, play-building and devising, clowning, scripted drama/script interpretation
6.  presenting and performing drama for audiences in available, informal and/or formal settings, including as appropriate, school-hosted digital spaces such as a school learning management system.

## Strands

### Exploring and responding

##### AC9ADR6E01

explore ways that the elements of drama are combined to communicate ideas, perspectives and/or meaning in drama across, cultures, times, places and/or other contexts

**Elaborations**
*  exploring how drama is used within their own communities to maintain, continue and revitalise culture
*  identifying and discussing use of elements of drama such as space, time, language, movement, character and/or relationships in the drama; for example, using Viewpoints to develop questions such as, “What did you see in the drama?”, “How did the actors make the characters believable?”, “When was the drama set? (For example, time, place or other context)”, “What was the purpose of the drama?”
*  exploring drama from other places and times, and discussing how it might contribute to their own drama, and how cultural understandings shape meaning in drama; for example, exploring how drama is used to share cultural knowledge in celebrations, ceremonies or rituals that happen in their local community and/or in another place, such as a country or region in Asia

##### AC9ADR6E02

explore the ways that First Nations Australians use drama to continue and revitalise cultures

**Elaborations**
*  exploring how performances that tell stories maintain culture; for example, narrative drama that communicates knowledge about land, sea, sky or waterways
*  identifying and discussing the role of storytelling in First Nations Australians’ cultural traditions, through direct engagement or using online resources created or co-created by First Nations Australians
*  identifying examples that illustrate how cultural expressions change over time; for example, by using available resources published by First Nations Australian communities and organisations
*  investigating the ways that a diverse range of First Nations Australian drama makers and performers embed themselves and their communities in drama in a range of representative forms as a visual declaration of identity, storytelling and resilience; for example, exploring how drama is used to share cultural narratives

### Developing practices and skills

##### AC9ADR6D01

explore ways to combine the elements of drama to communicate ideas, perspectives and/or meaning in improvisations, devised drama and/or scripted drama

**Elaborations**
*  experimenting with empathy to develop characters and relationships in drama, considering situations from the perspectives of different characters, exploring responses and challenging stereotypes; for example, when interpreting scripted drama
*  imagining and developing a “new scene” to include in a dramatic re-telling of a known narrative
*  using Viewpoints to ask questions to explore the role of cultures in the use of elements of drama, such as “How are relationships, language and symbols shaped by cultures?”, “How do we use our own cultures to create shortcuts of meaning and ideas?”, “How do we understand the cultures of others?”
*  using improvisation or process drama to compare different ways that improvised and scripted drama can create characters and action, or evaluating drama they experience in live performance and considering how they can use specific techniques in their own work
*  imagining that they are in the time/place of an historical event and considering why people involved in the event made (or will make) certain decisions and/or what they could have done differently

### Creating and making

##### AC9ADR6C01

develop characters and situations, and shape and sustain dramatic action to communicate ideas, perspectives and/or meaning in improvised, devised and/or scripted forms

**Elaborations**
*  exploring physical, fictional or emotional spaces to create characters and respond to situations
*  varying use of voice/vocalisation using techniques such as projection, dynamics, pace, pause and pitch, to create and communicate characters’ intentions, or exploring how movement and gesture can be used without voice/vocalisation to communicate ideas or intentions
*  rehearsing, interacting and negotiating with others to interpret scripts and create characters and their relationships
*  using Viewpoints to ask questions when exploring character; for example, “How did the performers use the elements of drama and design elements effectively?”, “For what purposes did they make drama?”, “What evidence supports your judgement about the drama?”
*  devising drama based on research or knowledge about a project happening in their school/local community to encourage cultural awareness or to present different perspectives in a debate, such as a debate about an environmental issue
*  working collaboratively to devise drama for a school ritual, gathering (such as an assembly) or ceremony; for example, drama that explores a school motto, a health message or a campaign such as “no-packaging lunch”

### Presenting and performing

##### AC9ADR6P01

rehearse and perform improvised, devised and/or scripted drama in informal and/or formal settings

**Elaborations**
*  using props, costumes and available technologies such as light, sound or multimedia to create dramatic symbols and enhance dramatic action
*  focusing on communication with the audience by, for example, remembering lines, moves and cues in rehearsal and performance
*  showing understanding of the purpose of rehearsing and the need for collaboration
*  sharing ideas about their drama with audiences; for example, through choice of performance space, approach to entering or leaving the performance space, pre-show presentations or by creating an introduction such as a podcast that can be distributed when an audience member obtains their ticket
