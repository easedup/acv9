# The Arts - Drama - Years 3 and 4

## Level Description

In this band, learning in The Arts builds on each student’s prior learning and experiences. Arts learning continues to use purposeful and creative play-based activities that foster development of students’ identity and wellbeing, and their connection with and contribution to the world. Students further develop their capability and confidence in using subject-specific skills, and creative and critical practices. They work individually and in collaboration with peers and teachers.

Students continue to explore drama that they experience at home, school or through family and community events. They connect with people living and working in the community who create and/or perform drama; for example, by experiencing live or virtual performances. They use stimulus materials such as images, events, texts, questions and observations as inspiration for their own making and responding . These experiences support students to develop aesthetic knowledge across cognitive, sensory, emotive and physical domains, and to value arts works and practices from across cultures, times, places and/or other contexts such as countries or cultures in Asia.

In this band, the focus is on students:

1.  exploring and responding to

*   works and experiences that showcase where, why and how drama is created, performed and used across cultures, times, places and/or other contexts; for example, participating in drama events as performer and audience
*   examples of drama created and/or performed by First Nations Australians that communicate connection to and responsibility for Country/Place

3.  developing creative and critical practices and skills

*   creative practices for creating and performing drama using elements of drama such as role, situation, language, place, movement, character, relationships, voice and time
*   critical practices for observing, reflecting on and responding to drama they experience, including their own drama

5.  creating drama in improvised and devised forms such as dramatic play, process drama, puppetry, improvisation, Readers’ Theatre, mime and movement, and/or basic play-building
6.  performing drama in informal settings such as spaces within the school.

### Exploring and responding

##### AC9ADR4E01

explore where, why and how drama is created and/or performed across cultures, times, places and/or other contexts

**Elaborations**
*  listening to actors in a drama created for purposes such as entertainment or infotainment talk about how they developed their character and what they found interesting or surprising about the imaginary world they created; then considering and discussing the actors’ responses
*  comparing the expectations and requirements of performers and audience in a range of cultural settings, such as cultural settings in Australia and Asia, and applying this learning in their own performances; for example, identifying how the audience and performers interact and what knowledge the audience needs to have about the drama
*  reflecting on live or recorded drama performances and asking questions such as “What is the purpose of this drama?”, “What features and ideas in the drama come from other cultures, times and places?”, “How could we use these ideas in our drama?”, “Why do you think people from diverse cultures create drama for similar purposes?”
*  examining drama in their community and comparing it to other drama of different people, times and cultures; for example, exploring examples of puppetry and/or physical (movement-based) theatre in their communities and comparing this with examples of those forms from other cultures, times or places
*  reflecting on and sharing ideas with others about the meaning and intended purposes of their own drama; for example, sharing embodied responses using movement, gesture or language

##### AC9ADR4E02

explore how First Nations Australians use drama to communicate their connection to, and responsibility for, Country/Place

**Elaborations**
*  collecting and sharing information about drama created and performed by First Nations Australians for occasions such as festivals or ceremonies, reflecting on how these performances can communicate important information or knowledge about Country/Place
*  exploring how First Nations Australians use drama to express connection to and responsibility for Country/Place, such as communicating knowledge or maintaining unique ways of life; for example, exploring how drama is used to communicate knowledge about the local environment
*  observing how the elements of drama are used in drama created and/or performed by First Nations Australians to communicate connection to and responsibility for Country/Place; for example, in drama that shares cultural narratives
*  accessing drama created and/or performed by First Nations Australians and exploring how drama communicates knowledge, such as ways to live sustainably, and to respect and care for the land, sea, sky or waterways
*  looking at performances that represent the importance of Country/Place and Story for First Nations Australians as a starting point for talking about different ways of seeing the same place and telling stories

### Developing practices and skills

##### AC9ADR4D01

use the elements of drama to explore and develop ideas for dramatic action in improvisations and/or devised drama

**Elaborations**
*  experimenting with the loudness/softness, pace and pitch of their voices/vocalisations to create roles and situations, time and place; for example, when initiating and developing roles and situations in process drama
*  exploring roles and situations; for example, by using language (choice of words, expressions and tone) or experimenting with ways to heighten tension in the dramatic action
*  improvising ways to connect short scenes, such as clapping a rhythmic pattern, saying words or phrases and/or through movement
*  developing spatial awareness when creating dramatic action; for example, considering how close/far apart they should stand to others in the performance space or how they can use movement to manipulate tension

### Creating and making

##### AC9ADR4C01

improvise and/or devise and shape drama using the elements of drama to communicate ideas, perspectives and/or meaning

**Elaborations**
*  using learning from explorations of drama that communicate First Nations Australians’ connection to and responsibility for Country/Place to devise drama that communicates their own connection to and responsibility for place; for example, devising drama that communicates their feelings about a “favourite” place or shows how they care for a place in their community
*  creating drama by exploring and experiencing a range of roles and situations that they initiate and develop; for example, exploring roles and situations in a “miniature world”
*  improvising drama to explore issues and ideas, considering how empathy can assist them to take on roles, accept situations and “stand in the shoes” of another; for example, comparing their own and their peers’ responses to “everyday” interactions or imagining themselves as participants in an event that is happening or happened in another time or place
*  devising dialogue for a previously “wordless story” or devising dramatic action/movement for a story they know only through spoken (audio) sources
*  using the elements of drama and the principles of story to shape improvisations to communicate their intentions as drama makers; for example, establishing time and place, and the roles and characters in the drama
*  working in groups to devise sections of a drama (for example, using process drama strategies) and then, working as a class, using a guided play-building process to combine the sections
*  communicating with an audience their connection to and responsibility for Country/Place by Acknowledging Country before a performance or presentation, taking care to observe protocols and using resources created or co-created by First Nations Australians, and/or by participating with Elders in a Welcome to Country (as appropriate)

### Presenting and performing

##### AC9ADR4P01

perform improvised and/or devised drama in informal settings

**Elaborations**
*  using voice, movement and language to sustain role and relationships when performing drama; for example, varying facial expressions and movements to create roles and situations
*  demonstrating commitment to the reality/world of the drama; for example, staying “in-role” throughout the performance (even when not actively participating in the dramatic action)
*  manipulating focus, tension, space and time to shape dramatic action when performing their drama
