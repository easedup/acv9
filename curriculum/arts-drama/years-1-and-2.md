# Drama - Years 1 and 2 {#drama-years-1-and-2}

## Level Description {#level-description}

In this band, learning in The Arts builds on each student’s prior learning and experiences. Students continue to learn through purposeful and creative play in structured learning programs designed to foster a strong sense of wellbeing and develop their connection with and contribution to the world. They work individually and in collaboration with peers and teachers, drawing on their imagination, real-life experiences and learnings from across the curriculum.

Students explore drama that they experience at home, school or through family and community events. They connect with people living and working in the community who create and/or perform drama; for example, by experiencing live or virtual performances. They use stimulus materials such as images, events, texts, questions and observations as inspiration for their own drama. These experiences support students to develop aesthetic knowledge across cognitive, sensory, emotive and physical domains, and to value arts works and practices from across cultures, communities and/or other contexts.

In this band, the focus is on students:

1.  exploring and responding to

*   drama across cultures, communities and/or other contexts through experiencing and participating
*   examples of drama created and/or performed by First Nations Australians

3.  developing creative and critical practices

*   creative practices for creating and performing drama, using the elements of drama such as role, situation, language, place and movement
*   critical practices such as observing, reflecting on and responding to drama they experience, including their own drama

5.  creating drama using forms such as dramatic play, process drama, puppetry, improvisation, Readers’ Theatre and/or mime and movement
6.  performing/sharing drama in informal settings such as classroom presentations.

##### AC9ADR2E01 {#ac9adr2e01}

explore where, why and how people across cultures, communities and/or other contexts experience drama

**Elaborations**
*  identifying where they might experience drama in their lives and community; for example, sharing experiences of attending drama performances at their school or taking part in drama in their community, and considering why these performances might have been created
*  recognising how drama can show feelings and ideas that people have about the world or personal experiences
*  asking questions about the drama they experience; for example, “How and why are these people making drama?”, “Where are they making drama?”, “What is the drama about?”
*  considering how drama communicates cultural knowledge in their own communities; for example, exploring how drama communicates stories, traditions and experiences that are important to people, such as drama that communicates stories from cultures, countries or regions in Asia

##### AC9ADR2E02 {#ac9adr2e02}

explore examples of drama created and/or performed by First Nations Australians

**Elaborations**

*  exploring First Nations Australians’ use of drama to express connection to and responsibility for Country/Place, such as communicating knowledge about the local seasons, or storytelling to communicate knowledge to maintain unique ways of life
*  observing how the elements of drama such as place, language and movement are used in First Nations Australians’ cultural expressions that they experience; for example, through direct engagement or using resources created or co-created by First Nations Australians
*  exploring ways of communicating knowledge through stories; for example, learning about stories that communicate knowledge of the environment in their region, through direct engagement (co-creating drama to share the knowledge) or using resources created or co-created by First Nations Australians
*  co-creating a Welcome to Country (as appropriate) or an Acknowledgement of Country to perform before their drama class with a First Nations Australian person who has cultural authority, or using advice from a resource such as protocols from their school sector

### Developing practices and skills {#developing-practices-and-skills}

##### AC9ADR2D01 {#ac9adr2d01}

use the elements of drama and imagination in dramatic play and/or process drama

**Elaborations**
*  exploring a situation through dramatic play using familiar props; for example, empty containers (boxes, plastic bottles, food packaging), clothing or toys
*  understanding and employing appropriate drama terminology when discussing drama they have created and/or experienced; for example, using terms such as dramatic play, process drama, pretending, audience, theatre, performance, actors

*  taking turns in offering and accepting ideas, and staying in a role when participating in improvised drama
*  brainstorming and discussing situations based on their experiences, such as situations related to games played during break time, and using these ideas to improvise drama

### Creating and making {#creating-and-making}

##### AC9ADR2C01 {#ac9adr2c01}

create and co-create fictional situations based on imagination and/or experience

**Elaborations**
*  using puppets to create new stories, including stories that communicate their understanding of existing stories or personal experiences; for example, using puppets they have made from repurposed or recycled materials and/or puppets that are modelled on puppets used in an Asian culture
*  using learning from explorations of drama that communicates First Nations Australians’ connection to and responsibility for Country/Place to devise drama that communicates their own connection to and responsibility for place; for example, devising short scenes that communicate feelings about a “favourite” place or show how they care for a place in their community
*  using costume items and props to share information about their character with other participants in the drama when “in-role” during Readers’ Theatre
*  identifying situations drawn from stories, films, fantasy, history or personal experience that might be explored through dramatic play, process drama or puppetry
*  considering how unstructured materials might be used to create play spaces, or everyday clothing items might be used to symbolise roles (hats, coats, lab coats, briefcases, etc.)
*  contributing ideas and actions within whole group or small group improvisations as part of a process drama to support or extend the offerings of others, including teacher-in-role
*  communicating non-verbally by using facial expressions and movements to explore and show role and situation when participating in mime or movement-based drama
*  accepting the pretence situation established by others or participating in its active development; for example, by creating relevant props and suggesting relevant roles or additional situations to explore
*  using inquiry questions to propose situations to explore in dramatic play and process drama, such as “What else might happen to these characters?”, “What might happen next?”, “What might have happened before the story?”, “What if I was there?”

### Presenting and performing {#presenting-and-performing}

##### AC9ADR2P01 {#ac9adr2p01}

share their drama in informal settings

**Elaborations**
*  retelling a familiar story through acting and sharing with an audience
*  performing sequences of frozen images linked by transitions in order to communicate key scenes from a familiar story

Why?”

## Achievement Standards {#achievement-standards}
