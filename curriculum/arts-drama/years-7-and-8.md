# The Arts - Drama - Years 7 and 8

## Level Description

In this band, learning in Drama builds on each student’s prior learning and experiences. Students learn in and through the practices of Drama: creating, performing and responding. They use drama processes in purposeful and creative ways, and continue to develop their connection with and contribution to the world as artist and as audience. They work individually and in collaboration with peers and teachers.

Students explore drama in local, regional, national and global contexts such as drama in countries or regions of Asia, including use of drama in multi-arts, trans-disciplinary or hybrid forms. They take opportunities to engage with living performers and drama-makers, and expand their awareness of diverse drama practices, genres and/or styles.

In this band, the focus is on students:

1.  exploring and responding to

*   drama works, performances, practices and contexts from a range of cultures, times and places; for example, through analysis of their own drama or the work of others, including professional work
*   the diversity of drama created and/or performed by First Nations Australians and how this work demonstrates respect for Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property rights

3.  developing practices and skills

*   creative practices for creating and performing drama using the elements of drama: role, situation, language, place, movement, time, character, relationships, voice, tension, space, mood/atmosphere, contrast, symbol and focus, and conventions relevant to selected forms and/or styles
*   critical practices by taking opportunities to reflect, evaluate or respond to their own work and the work of others; for example, documenting ideas and intentions for devised drama, evaluating their own or others’ responses to drama, reflecting on their own performances

5.  creating drama in improvised, devised and scripted forms such as process drama, puppetry, object theatre, short- or long-form improvisation, play-building and devising, scripted drama/script interpretation; for example, interpretation of realism and/or non-realism, exploration of historic, contemporary or hybrid styles
6.  presenting and performing drama in informal and/or formal settings; for example, performing for a specific target audience.

## Strands

### Exploring and responding

##### AC9ADR8E01

investigate ways the elements of drama and/or conventions are used to communicate ideas, perspectives and/or meaning in drama created and/or performed across cultures, times, places and/or other contexts

**Elaborations**
*  researching and noticing how the impact of time and place/context of a drama from a particular period can differ from that of another period, particularly in relation to the use of drama conventions
*  using Viewpoints to analyse and evaluate performances they have experienced and/or participated in by asking questions such as “What ideas did you think the drama expressed?”, “What conventions were used to establish time/place/context?”, “How was movement used in the drama?”
*  writing or pod/vodcasting a review of a drama they experience, focusing on use of specific elements of drama and/or conventions; for example, identifying and describing how an element of drama has been manipulated to communicate ideas, perspectives and/or meaning
*  analysing how linear and non-linear narrative is used in examples of drama from diverse cultures; for example, in contemporary drama from countries or regions in Asia or in drama from historical times

##### AC9ADR8E02

investigate the diversity of drama created and/or performed by First Nations Australians, considering culturally responsive approaches to Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property rights

**Elaborations**
*  identifying how diverse examples of drama created and/or performed by First Nations Australians can consider and demonstrate culturally responsive approaches to Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property rights
*  using information from Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property protocols and guidelines to inform decisions about whether or not ideas from an existing source featuring cultural expressions can be used when developing new drama work
*  engaging in activities that enable understanding of how to make ethical choices and empathise with content creators and story owners; for example, asking questions such as, “Whose story is it?”, “Is this my story to share or should I ask permission to tell it?”
*  investigating specific examples of how drama practitioners select and use First Nations Australians’ historical and cultural material to develop and create contemporary First Nations Australian theatre; for example, using historical and cultural materials that accurately communicate First Nations Australian perspectives, such as resilience to the impacts of colonisation
*  identifying and analysing what cultural appropriation is and how to avoid it by considering the original purpose, context and intended audience of cultural expressions; for example, using advice from protocols for protecting Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property rights

### Developing practices and skills

##### AC9ADR8D01

develop performance skills relevant to selected drama styles and/or forms

**Elaborations**
*  developing vocal qualities of projection, clarity and contrast through control of pace, pitch, dynamics and use of pause and silence
*  developing use of the body to communicate through, for example, movement and stillness, realistic and non-realistic movement; and developing performance skills such as exploring ways to transition between scenes
*  experimenting with ways to use conventions associated with a specific style/form in their drama; for example, conventions such as flashback/flashforward, aside, slow motion, chorus (commentator), signs, sound/music
*  experimenting with the elements of drama, relevant stylistic conventions or ways of manipulating form to create, shape and sustain dramatic action, situations and narratives, in order to achieve intended meaning and purpose; for example, through class, individual and group activities such as improvisation and basic devising in a selected style or in response to provided stimulus material
*  using improvisation to explore techniques/strategies associated with specific styles/forms to heighten and release tension and using ideas from the improvisation to interpret scenes from a scripted drama
*  experimenting with ways to manipulate elements of drama and use performance skills to communicate status/power relationships in drama being devised and/or when interpreting scripts
*  understanding the importance of and applying respectful relationships and empathy when developing roles and characters, and conveying historical and cultural ideas and meaning

##### AC9ADR8D02

reflect on their own and others’ drama to inform choices when manipulating elements of drama and/or conventions to shape dramatic action

**Elaborations**
*  reflecting, independently and in class discussion, upon the action created in order to evaluate and analyse what was effective and make decisions about what would be done differently in future; for example, discussing whether the purpose was achieved, whether the action was engaging, whether the elements could have been managed differently for better effect, and which of the elements worked well to make meaning clear
*  seeking, accepting and responding to feedback to inform choices about use of elements of drama and/or conventions; for example, using Viewpoints to develop questions such as “How did the performer use language/movement to make their character believable?”, “What ideas/perspectives/meaning did the drama communicate?”, “What do you think will/could/should happen next?”, “How would you describe the relationship/s between the characters in this scene?”
*  developing understanding of human behaviours and emotions using appropriate boundaries, by recalling and re-enacting past experiences and people they have observed in situations relevant to the text or content being used; asking “What did my/their body do?”, “How did my/their voice sound/communicate meaning in the situation?”, “How can I adapt my facial expression, posture, gesture, movement and voice/vocalisation to portray age, power or attitude?”, “How can I express character relationships through vocal dynamics, eye contact, distance and space?”
*  reflecting on how performance skills are used to communicate perspectives; for example, how performance skills can be used in drama that seeks to communicate ideas such as perpetuating or challenging unequal power relationships and oppression

### Creating and making

##### AC9ADR8C01

improvise and devise drama and/or interpret scripted drama, manipulating elements of drama and applying conventions relevant to the style/form

**Elaborations**
*  identifying dramatic potential in teacher-provided/directed starting points such as research, examples of the conventions of drama forms/performance styles, dramatic text, the structuring of forms, or discussion of peers’ responses to an issue or topic; then using improvisation and processes such as “mantle of the expert” to develop situations, characters, and make decisions that shape the resulting dramatic action
*  using play-building to develop a series of scenes as a class response to an inquiry question or responding to dramatic potential of an image by imagining, “What’s happening? What has happened? What’s going to happen next?”
*  working collaboratively to interpret scripted drama; for example, deciding where/when the action will take place, using improvisation to explore and understand characters and relationships, applying conventions relevant to the style/form, blocking use of the performance space to establish context, relationships or transitions, selecting/sourcing and rehearsing with props/set items
*  using Viewpoints to frame questions to interpret, analyse and evaluate the effectiveness of dramatic forms, elements, design and conventions or making decisions about how to communicate idea, effects and intentions; for example, “What were the actor’s/director’s intentions in this drama?”, “What ideas did you think the drama expressed?”, “How did you engage with the drama?”
*  employing voice/vocalisation and movement appropriate to situation, and manipulating space and time in dramatic action to heighten tension, focus action and shape meaning
*  using feedback, reflection or evaluation to develop and extend ideas when improvising, devising and/or scripting drama

##### AC9ADR8C02

evaluate and refine use of elements of drama and/or conventions to shape and sustain dramatic action and/or communicate ideas, perspectives and/or meaning

**Elaborations**
*  refining drama during the rehearsal process by using feedback, evaluation, documentation and personal reflection, after using Viewpoints to ask questions such as “What are your intentions in the drama you are making?”, “Is the meaning clear?”, “How could elements, conventions, design (costume, props, setting) and performance skills (voice and movement) be used differently to achieve these effects?”
*  adjusting performance based on audience response; for example, character's portrayal of emotion or delivery of lines to make meaning clear
*  planning, organising and rehearsing dramatic action to stage devised and scripted drama; for example, arranging use of available theatre technologies and collaborating in rehearsal to stage drama for a clear and intended purpose and effect, considering choices within the overall structure
*  considering how and why empathy should be considered when creating effects and communicating intended meaning; for example, exploring conventions for developing characters and stories in drama from a range of cultures

**Elaborations**
*  performing and using conventions relevant to style, suiting choices to the underlying dramatic structure
*  collecting and evaluating audience feedback to enhance future performance
*  using Viewpoints to ask reflective questions such as “What were your intentions in the drama?”, “Was meaning made clear for the audience?”, “What audience reaction or feedback did you get to suggest it was engaging?”
