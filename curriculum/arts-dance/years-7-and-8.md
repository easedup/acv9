# Dance - Years 7 and 8 {#dance-years-7-and-8}

## Level Description {#level-description}

In this band, learning in Dance builds on each student’s prior learning and experiences. Students learn in and through the practices of Dance: choreography, performance and responding. They use dance-specific processes in purposeful and creative ways, and continue to develop their connection with and contribution to the world as artist and as audience. They work individually and in collaboration with peers and teachers.

Students explore dance in local, regional, national and global contexts such as dance in countries or regions of Asia, including use of dance in multi-arts, trans-disciplinary or hybrid forms. They take opportunities to engage with living performers and choreographers, and expand their awareness of the diversity of dance practices, genres and/or styles.

In this band, the focus is on students:

1.  exploring and responding to

*   dance works, the work of performers and choreographers, dance practices across cultures, times and places and/or other contexts; for example, through analysis and/or practical investigations such as improvisation
*   the diversity of dance choreographed and/or performed by First Nations Australians and how this work demonstrates respect for Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property rights

3.  developing practices and skills

*   creative practices for performance and choreography, considering prior learning, safe dance practice, experience and interests. For example, students may focus on individual and ensemble or genre- or style-specific skills, techniques or processes. They build and refine technical and expressive skills, and skills to manipulate the elements of dance
*   critical practices by taking opportunities to reflect, evaluate or respond to their own work and the work of others; for example, documenting use of a choreographic process or ideas and intentions for a dance work or performance, evaluating their own and others’ responses to dance works, reflecting on development of skills and techniques

5.  creating/choreographing dance to communicate their intentions as choreographers, using the elements of dance, choreographic devices and form. Students may focus on choreographing in a range of dance styles and forms and/or choreographing for multi-arts, hybrid or trans-disciplinary work such as screen-based or theatrical forms
6.  presenting and performing dance using technical and expressive skills to communicate their ideas and intentions to audiences; for example, through planned and rehearsed live or streamed performances, as appropriate.

## Strands {#strands}

### Exploring and responding {#exploring-and-responding}

##### AC9ADA8E01 {#ac9ada8e01}

investigate ways that dance works, performers and/or choreographers across cultures, times, places and/or other contexts use the elements of dance, choreographic devices and/or production elements to communicate ideas, perspectives and/or meaning

**Elaborations**
*  analysing dances from a range of times and locations, such as dances from times they are studying in History or dance from a country or region in Asia, and considering how a single realistic movement can be manipulated from representational to symbolic (literal to abstract)
*  investigating the development of dance styles in different artistic, social, environmental, historical or cultural contexts; for example, identifying the distinguishing stylistic features of dances in a range of styles or from a range of times or places, and considering how these can inform their choreography
*  using Viewpoints to explore questions such as “What was the choreographer’s intention for this dance?”, “What ideas did you think the dance expressed?”
*  comparing use of one or more elements of dance and/or choreographic devices such as repetition in dances from a range of genres/styles, cultures, times and/or places; for example, dances from a range of cultures or countries in Asia
*  investigating how digital tools and use of immersive technologies such as virtual reality (VR) are influencing choreography, performance or use of production elements

##### AC9ADA8E02 {#ac9ada8e02}

investigate the diversity of dance choreographed and/or performed by First Nations Australians considering culturally responsive approaches to Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property rights

**Elaborations**
*  exploring information about Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property rights that is available to help dance practitioners understand how to make ethical choices; for example, asking questions such as “Who created this dance or these movements?”
*  using and annotating a map of First Nations Australian language groups to identify where First Nations Australian choreographers and/or performers are working and provide short descriptions of the dance they are choreographing and/or performing
*  analysing how linear and non-linear narrative is used in specific examples of dance choreographed and/or performed by First Nations Australians to explore issues such as relationships, identity or empathy
*  investigating an example of cultural appropriation where it has been found that First Nations Australian Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property rights have been denied and identifying how this situation could have been approached respectfully; for example, a situation where a choreographer has used movement vocabulary that carries cultural knowledge without permission from the knowledge holders

### Developing practices and skills {#developing-practices-and-skills}

##### AC9ADA8D01 {#ac9ada8d01}

develop safe dance practice and use of expressive and technical skills and, as appropriate, genre- or style-specific techniques

**Elaborations**
*  developing dance skills and style-specific techniques; for example, experimenting to extend their own movement vocabulary by improvising using movements and techniques from diverse dance styles
*  exploring how expressive skills can be used to communicate ideas; for example, using gesture or facial expression to communicate relationships or emotions
*  extending technical competence such as control, coordination, accuracy, alignment, balance, flexibility, strength, endurance and articulation when moving, in response to self, peer and/or teacher feedback

##### AC9ADA8D02 {#ac9ada8d02}

reflect on own and others’ dance works and/or practices to inform choreographic choices and use of technical and expressive skills

**Elaborations**
*  reflecting on how they have used or extended their movement vocabulary and considering options for further development
*  evaluating influences on their own performance or choreography; for example, using a journal to document interesting examples of how others use an element of dance or genre- or style-specific techniques, and considering how to use these ideas in their own choreography or performance
*  reflecting on feedback from peers who have observed a workshop or a rehearsal and using ideas from the feedback/reflection to refine dance; for example, use of technical and expressive skills or a choreographic device

### Creating and making {#creating-and-making}

##### AC9ADA8C01 {#ac9ada8c01}

choreograph dance by selecting and manipulating elements of dance and choreographic devices to communicate ideas, perspectives and/or meaning

**Elaborations**
*  exploring ways to use elements of dance and choreographic devices to portray characters and stories respectfully and empathetically
*  experimenting with ways to use the elements of dance and choreographic devices to represent ideas about themes or issues such as social relationships through dance; for example, through improvisation
*  selecting movements from an improvisation, such as an improvisation focusing on communication of mood or emotion, and organising it for use in a music video or as short phrases that participants in an immersive experience such as VR can use
*  selecting, combining, refining and sequencing movement using choreographic devices such as transitions, variation and contrast, and choreographic forms such as binary, ternary and narrative
*  analysing and evaluating the structural choices made in their dance by documenting their process in records such as journals, blogs, video or audio recordings, securing permission where appropriate

##### AC9ADA8C02 {#ac9ada8c02}

apply technical and expressive skills and/or genre- or style-specific techniques to communicate ideas, perspectives and/or meaning

**Elaborations**
*  applying technical skills such as strength, balance or coordination to intensify communication of mood/atmosphere in a dance they are choreographing and/or performing
*  responding to feedback to enhance communication of choreographic intent to the audience; for example, by refining use of technical skills such as accuracy or flexibility
*  using questions based on Viewpoints to evaluate clarity of movement, projection, focus and musicality when preparing for a performance, and using video to evaluate and refine spatial placement or articulation

### Presenting and performing {#presenting-and-performing}

##### AC9ADA8P01 {#ac9ada8p01}

rehearse and perform dance for audiences, using technical and expressive skills and, as appropriate genre- or style-specific techniques

**Elaborations**
*  planning effective use of available performance spaces during rehearsals
*  using production elements such as projection, soundscape, music, special effects or voice-overs to share key ideas or information about the creative intention of the dance with the audience
*  using technical and expressive skills and, as appropriate, genre- or style-specific techniques when performing dance they have learnt and/or choreographed
*  using rehearsal strategies or techniques such as spotting to enhance confidence, clarity of movement, projection, focus and musicality in performance
*  introducing their dance to an audience; for example, in a program note or voice-over that uses descriptive style-specific dance terminology
