# Dance - Years 5 and 6 {#dance-years-5-and-6}

## Level Description {#level-description}

In this band, students continue to learn in and through their practices of The Arts subjects, building on their prior learning and experiences. They work creatively and purposefully, and continue to develop their connection with and contribution to the world as artist and as audience. They work individually and in collaboration with peers and teachers.

Students engage with dance works, choreographers and/or performers across cultures, times, places and/or other contexts; for example, exploring dance in their local area, state/territory or a country or region of Asia. They take opportunities to engage with living choreographers and/or performers and their works; for example, by experiencing live or virtual performances. They continue to use stimulus materials such as images, events, texts, questions and observations as inspiration for their own dance. These experiences support students to develop aesthetic knowledge across cognitive, sensory, emotive and physical domains and to value arts works and practices from diverse cultures.

In this band, the focus is on students:

1.  exploring and responding to

*   dance from local, regional, national and global cultures, times, places and/or other contexts that shows how the elements of dance that can be used to communicate ideas, perspectives and/or meaning
*   dance that showcases how First Nations Australians are continuing and revitalising cultures

3.  developing creative and critical practices and skills

*   creative practices for choreography and performance using safe dance practice, fundamental movement skills, the elements of dance, imagination, and processes such as improvisation that allow them to extend and refine their movement capabilities
*   critical practices by observing, reflecting on and responding to dance they experience, including their own dance

5.  creating dances by developing ideas and structuring movements to communicate their intentions as choreographers. They may focus on creating a dance work or they may create work that combines dance and another arts form, such as a dance for a media arts production
6.  presenting and performing dance they have learnt and/or choreographed for audiences, in available, informal and/or formal settings including, as appropriate, school-hosted digital spaces such as a school learning management system.

## Strands {#strands}

### Exploring and responding {#exploring-and-responding}

##### AC9ADA6E01 {#ac9ada6e01}

explore ways that the elements of dance are combined to communicate ideas, perspectives and/or meaning in dance across cultures, times, places and/or other contexts

**Elaborations**
*  exploring how dances they experience use the elements of dance and choreographic devices such as repetition, unison or contrast; for example, exploring culturally specific dance from a country or region in Asia, or dance on screen
*  seeking feedback about how ideas in a dance were perceived/understood by the audience; for example, checking how the audience interpreted movements such as stop and start/percussive arm and upper body movements intended to express basketball actions in a game, or rhythmic and accented movement intended to express the passage of time, or the actions of a clock
*  discussing the purpose of movements, elements of dance, production elements, technical and expressive skills, such as use of projection and focus, and how these affect the mood of audience and the relationship between dancers and the audience
*  asking questions based on Viewpoints to explore similarities and differences in ways that choreographers or performers and audiences experience/respond to aspects of a dance; for example, “How were elements of dance used to communicate the main idea in the dance?”, “How was your mood changed by this dance?” and developing and asking questions that refer to energy, shape, tempo or use of production elements such as props or music
*  exploring how dance is used to communicate cultural traditions; for example, considering dance from a country or region in Asia and asking, “What stories, narratives or ways of being and doing does this dance reflect?”, “Is this dance communicating something about the culture where it originated that we can’t learn any other way?”, “How is this dance evolving over time? For example, are costumes now made from different materials?”

##### AC9ADA6E02 {#ac9ada6e02}

explore the ways that First Nations Australians use dance to continue and revitalise cultures

**Elaborations**
*  exploring, using resources created or co-created by First Nations Australians, how and why cultural expressions are critical for sharing continuing or revitalising cultures
*  investigating how meaning and purpose are communicated in dance choreographed and/or performed by First Nations Australians; for example, observing how movements are used to share cultural knowledge with the broader community in a dance performed at a community event, or using resources created or co-created by First Nations Australians
*  experiencing how First Nations Australians’ telling of ways stories and ideas communicate connection to and responsibility for Country/Place; for example, exploring how dance communicates knowledge about weather events or knowledge of sustainable practices for caring for land, sea, sky and waterway
*  using Viewpoints to develop questions to build understanding about First Nations Australians’ dances and exploring what they could investigate further, such as “What do I already know about this dance practice?”, “What do I need to learn to have a better understanding?”, “What knowledge can I share with others?”, “What questions would I ask the dancers about this performance?”
*  exploring how dances that tell stories maintain culture; for example, narrative dances that communicate knowledge about sustainable approaches to locating and gathering food or stories about how places got their names

### Developing practices and skills {#developing-practices-and-skills}

##### AC9ADA6D01 {#ac9ada6d01}

develop and practise technical and expressive skills using safe dance practice and the elements of dance

**Elaborations**
*  improvising new movement to communicate ideas in response to stimulus; for example, exploring how they can use different body parts, zones, bases and elements of dance to communicate/represent ideas about overcrowded cities; for example, groups of dancers in close proximity to each other
*  developing technical and expressive skills to refine their execution of fundamental movements such as galloping, jumping, sliding, rolling, slithering, spinning, shrinking, exploding or collapsing
*  developing expressive skills of focus, clarity of the movement, confidence and facial expression/character
*  exploring an element of dance; for example, experimenting with shapes and considering ideas such as positive and negative space or use of contrasting dynamics

### Creating and making {#creating-and-making}

##### AC9ADA6C01 {#ac9ada6c01}

manipulate the elements of dance and/or choreographic devices to choreograph dances that communicate ideas, perspectives and/or meaning

**Elaborations**
*  exploring character and mood by experimenting with the elements of dance, developing ideas for a narrative dance such as retelling a story and combining ideas for each section of the story to structure the dance
*  exploring a stimulus or analysing other dances to devise a variety of movement possibilities, such as different ways to jump and land, roll and stand or spiral down to the ground, and then selecting, combining, arranging and refining the movements to structure a dance; for example, using some movements in a repeating section that alternates with contrasting sections
*  using Viewpoints to frame questions when reflecting on development of their dance, “How is the movement of the body used to represent a story, character or idea?”, “How can we use space, costume or multimedia to communicate meaning in this dance?”
*  creating a dance that focuses on use of technical and expressive skills such as control, coordination and balance
*  creating a dance that explores a theme or an issue such as a theme from a known text or an issue relating to sustainable ways of living

### Presenting and performing {#presenting-and-performing}

##### AC9ADA6P01 {#ac9ada6p01}

practise and perform dances using technical and expressive skills in informal and/or formal settings

**Elaborations**
*  rehearsing and performing a range of learnt dance and/or dance they have choreographed with an awareness of how they are working within their body capabilities and applying technical and expressive skills
*  using specific technical and expressive skills in their performance to communicate ideas, perspectives and/or meaning to the audience; for example, creating tension through use of a series of slow, controlled movements performed with neutral (blank) facial expressions
*  presenting dances, using production elements such as music, costumes and props where appropriate to enhance different contexts; for example, using traditional music when performing dances with representatives of the cultural group from the community
*  using questions based on Viewpoints such as questions about forms and elements to reflect on their performance; for example, “How did the dancers/you use space and energy to create a feeling of strength/isolation/happiness?”, “What relationship are you aiming to create between the dancers and the audience?”
