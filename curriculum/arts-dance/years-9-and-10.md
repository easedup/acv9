# Dance - Years 9 and 10 {#dance-years-9-and-10}

## Level Description {#level-description}

In this band, learning in Dance continues to build on each student’s prior learning and experiences as students develop their capability and confidence across the practices of Dance: choreography, performance and responding. They continue to use dance-specific processes in purposeful and creative ways that are informed by their engagement with the work of living choreographers and performers from across local, regional, national and global cultures, times, places and/or other contexts, such as countries or regions in Asia. This can include use of dance in multi-arts, trans-disciplinary or hybrid forms. This awareness of diverse dance practices, genres and/or styles informs their own work as choreographers and performers. They work collaboratively with peers and teachers.

In this band, the focus is on students:

1.  exploring and responding to

*   choreographers’ and performers’ use of the elements of dance, choreographic devices, genre/style techniques and/or production elements in works or contexts across cultures, times and/or places; for example, through analysis or practical investigations
*   ways in which dance choreographed and/or performed by First Nations Australians celebrates and challenges multiple perspectives of Australian identity

3.  developing practices and skills

*   building and extending creative practices for performance and choreography, considering prior learning, safe dance practice, experience and interests. For example, students may continue to develop genre- or style-specific techniques and explore new interests to extend and refine technical and expressive skills
*   building and extending critical practices by taking opportunities to reflect on and evaluate their own work, respond to and analyse their own work

5.  creating work to communicate ideas and intentions using the elements of dance, choreographic devices and form. They use choreographic processes that are appropriate to the genre/style. As they develop and refine their work, students consider how they can employ technical and expressive skills to communicate ideas, perspectives and/or meaning in their work. Students may focus on choreographing in a range of dance styles and forms and/or they may choreograph dance for multi-arts, hybrid or trans-disciplinary works; for example, using immersive technologies
6.  performing their work using technical and expressive skills and genre- or style-specific techniques to communicate their ideas and intentions to audiences; for example, in planned and rehearsed live or streamed performances.

## Strands {#strands}

### Exploring and responding {#exploring-and-responding}

##### AC9ADA10E01 {#ac9ada10e01}

investigate performers’ and/or choreographers’ use of elements of dance, choreographic devices, genre- or style-specific techniques, conventions and/or production elements to communicate and/or challenge ideas, perspectives and/or meaning in dance across cultures, times, places and/or other contexts

**Elaborations**
*  investigating specific examples of how and why dance practitioners work collaboratively with communities, such as communities in Australia with cultural links to countries and/or regions in Asia
*  investigating how and why choreographers work with communities to advocate for sustainable ways of living, social justice and recognition of people or events
*  investigating why and how different traditions, styles and contexts affect the experience and interpretation of a dance work and taking this into account when choreographing and performing; for example, using Viewpoints to explore questions such as “What meaning is intended by the choreographer?”, “What cultural traditions are represented in this dance?” or “How does this work relate to my culture? To my life?”
*  extending their movement vocabulary as they explore their own stylistic preferences and personal identity; for example, using analysis of dance styles from a range of cultures they identify with or dance styles from different times to inform their choreographic practice
*  analysing use of elements of dance in different genres/styles, such as styles that feature in popular culture or from a country or region in Asia, as a stimulus for choreography or to inform performance of a learnt work

##### AC9ADA10E02 {#ac9ada10e02}

investigate the ways First Nations Australian choreographers and/or performers celebrate and challenge multiple perspectives of Australian identity through dance

**Elaborations**
*  evaluating ways that First Nations Australian performers and/or choreographers are working respectfully and collaboratively with communities to explore local histories, cultures and identities
*  investigating dance works that challenge our understandings about “first contacts” between the First Nations Peoples of Australia and people from Britain or Europe
*  exploring the ways that First Nations Australian choreographers and/or performers use their practice to communicate ideas, messages and lived experiences to the broader community

### Developing practices and skills {#developing-practices-and-skills}

##### AC9ADA10D01 {#ac9ada10d01}

develop and refine safe dance practice, expressive and technical skills and genre- or style-specific techniques

**Elaborations**
*  refining technical skills in response to self-reflection to develop safe dance practice and control, accuracy, strength, balance, alignment, flexibility, endurance, coordination and articulation
*  using experimentation and improvisation to develop techniques for executing expressive skills in a range of genres and/or styles
*  practising and refining technical skills to develop proficiency in genre- and style-specific techniques

##### AC9ADA10D02 {#ac9ada10d02}

reflect on own and others’ use of the elements of dance, choreographic devices, structure, genre- or style-specific techniques and/or technical and expressive skills to inform their choreographic or performance choices

**Elaborations**
*  using questions based on Viewpoints to reflect on and evaluate use of forms and elements; for example, “How can I use and manipulate the elements of space and dynamics to convey my ideas?”
*  evaluating choreographic and/or performance choices; for example, “How successful were the dancers in conveying the choreographer’s stated intent?” or “What was the impact of the performer’s choice to use gesture to communicate emotion?”
*  documenting their creative process, including the use of analysis and evaluation strategies, in reflective records
*  improvising using the elements of dance and analysing movement choices to reflect their individuality and to clarify their choreographic intent
*  considering how they can use the elements of dance and choreographic devices to reflect ways that meaning and experiences, political statements, critical theories or emotions influence and shape their approach to dance

### Creating and making {#creating-and-making}

##### AC9ADA10C01 {#ac9ada10c01}

choreograph dance that communicates ideas, perspectives and/or meaning by selecting and manipulating elements of dance, choreographic devices and/or structure

**Elaborations**
*  experimenting with ways to use and combine choreographic devices, such as addition and diminution, force and tempo or by using different body parts
*  using questions based on Viewpoints relating to forms and elements; such as “How can I use and manipulate the elements of space and dynamics to convey my ideas?”, for example, when choreographing a dance that conveys ideas, perspectives or meaning about identity, belonging or a social justice issue
*  investigating the use of the elements of dance in works of artists from different cultures, times and places, and adapting dance ideas to create movements that represent a synthesis of influences and present a personal meaning or perspective, using respectful dance practice
*  developing movement motifs and using choreographic devices or manipulating the elements of dance in innovative ways to communicate their choreographic intent
*  using motifs from a known dance as the starting point for their own choreography; for example, identifying and improvising on movements from a dance being shared via a social media platform to develop ideas that can be extended and structured into new work
*  using a style-specific form such as a form associated with a culturally specific dance genre/style, to structure a dance

##### AC9ADA10C02 {#ac9ada10c02}

apply technical and expressive skills and genre- or style-specific techniques to enhance communication of ideas, perspectives and/or meaning

**Elaborations**
*  applying knowledge of the structure and function of the musculoskeletal system to execute movements safely and prevent injury to themselves and others
