# Dance - Years 1 and 2 {#dance-years-1-and-2}

## Level Description {#level-description}

In this band, learning in The Arts builds on each student’s prior learning and experiences. Students continue to learn through purposeful and creative play in structured learning programs designed to foster a strong sense of wellbeing and develop their connection with and contribution to the world. They work individually and in collaboration with peers and teachers, drawing on their imaginations, real-life experiences, stimulus materials and learnings from across the curriculum.

Students explore dance that they experience at home, school and/or through family and community events. They connect with choreographers and/or performers who live and work in the community; for example, by experiencing live or virtual performances. They use stimulus materials such as images, events, texts, questions and observations as inspiration for their own dance practices. These experiences support students to develop aesthetic knowledge across cognitive, sensory, emotive and physical domains, and to value arts works and practices from across cultures, communities and/or other contexts.

In this band, the focus is on students:

1.  exploring and responding to

*   dance across cultures, communities and/or other contexts through inquiry and/or practical investigations, such as learning dances
*   examples of dance choreographed and/or performed by First Nations Australians

3.  developing critical and creative practices and skills

*   creative practices for choreography and performance using safe dance practice, fundamental movement skills, the elements of dance, imagination and processes such as improvisation
*   critical practices by observing, reflecting on and responding to dance they experience, including their own dance

5.  creating dance sequences by selecting and combining movements that communicate ideas and intentions using fundamental movement skills, the elements of dance and imagination. Students may focus on choreographing dance sequences, or they may create work that combines dance and other arts forms, such as a dance sequence for use in a dramatic re-telling of a story
6.  performing/sharing dance they have learnt and/or choreographed in informal settings such as classroom presentations.

## Strands {#strands}

### Exploring and responding {#exploring-and-responding}

##### AC9ADA2E01 {#ac9ada2e01}

explore where, why and how people across cultures, communities and/or other contexts experience dance

**Elaborations**
*  identifying features of dances that communicate cultural knowledge, such as stories, traditions or dances used in ceremonies
*  using Viewpoints to ask questions about dances they experience; for example, “What sort of movements did the dancers perform?”, “What are they wearing?”, “What kind of music are they dancing to?”, “How are they communicating the ideas or intentions in this dance?”
*  recognising and describing patterns of movement in dances, using their own words and learnt dance terminology
*  identifying similarities and differences in dances by sharing, viewing and/or learning dances that they are familiar with or have experienced with their families and communities
*  identifying how dance can show what feelings people have about places, people or experiences

##### AC9ADA2E02 {#ac9ada2e02}

explore examples of dance choreographed and/or performed by First Nations Australians

**Elaborations**
*  exploring when, where, how and why First Nations Australians use dance to share knowledge about their cultures; for example, during celebrations such as National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children’s Day, NAIDOC Week, Reconciliation Week or the acknowledgement of significant occasions including Sorry Day
*  observing how the elements of dance are used in choreography and/or performance by First Nations Australians; for example, exploring the movements with representatives of the First Nations Australian community or by using resources that are created or co-created by First Nations Australians
*  identifying where they might experience dance in First Nations Australians’ cultural expressions, such as in ceremonies at their school, in their community, or as part of state and national events, and taking notice of ways the performers and audiences observe protocols and respect Elders or knowledge holders
*  learning about First Nations Australians’ interpretations of the night sky; for example, working with First Nations Australians who have cultural authority to co-create movements to represent shapes and patterns that can be seen at different times of the year

### Developing practices and skills {#developing-practices-and-skills}

##### AC9ADA2D01 {#ac9ada2d01}

experiment with ways to move safely and expressively using fundamental movement skills and the elements of dance

**Elaborations**
*  developing awareness of, and taking responsibility for, their own safe dance practice; for example, being aware of self and others in the dance space, moving with care, respecting others dancing in the space; developing an awareness of the boundaries of the dance space and an awareness of what their bodies need; for example, getting a drink to hydrate themselves after dance activities
*  using improvisation to explore movement possibilities in response to a stimulus such as imagery, music or shared stories; for example, improvising movements in response to prompts such as “Make a long, narrow shape”, “Stretch the shape as wide as possible”, “Make your shape long, narrow and low/high”, “Connect your shape with the shape another person has made”, “Make your combined shape move sideways/forwards/in a circle/ backwards”
*  using Viewpoints to ask questions and identify movement possibilities, such as “What levels are you using in this dance, and why?”, “How are you communicating your ideas and intentions in this dance?”, “Are there other body parts you can use for this movement?”
*  exploring fundamental movements safely to develop ideas for movement; for example, ideas about familiar situations, objects, animals or environmental features, such as running in a race, jumping like a frog, stomping like a giant, rolling like a log, falling like an autumn leaf, floating like a cloud, gliding like a bird
*  moving around open and crowded spaces safely and using a variety of travelling steps, such as running, skipping, rolling, jumping, walking backwards and sideways movements; identifying the distance between themselves and others when dancing and using props such as scarves; and responding by reflecting on the space and movements that made them feel safe or unsafe

### Creating and making {#creating-and-making}

##### AC9ADA2C01 {#ac9ada2c01}

use the elements of dance to choreograph dance sequences

**Elaborations**
*  using improvised movements to create a dance sequence that represents a weather event, or shows how they might take care of a place that is important to them
*  using music they have created as inspiration for a dance, considering how they can use movement to communicate the rhythm/beat, texture (layers) or timbre (unique sound of each instrument/voice) in the music
*  devising a dance sequence; for example, devising a starting shape, a way of moving to another place in the dance space (considering level, direction, locomotor and non-locomotor movements) and then combining their ideas with a partner or a small group to extend the sequence
*  using ideas from an exploration of how they maintain balance, manipulate their posture, or move specific body parts, noting similarities and differences across individuals, groups or the whole class, to create a dance sequence
*  using patterns of movement such as a sequence of locomotor movements (travelling movements) they have improvised, sharing/teaching these movements to a partner (and learning the partner’s movements), and working collaboratively to combine and extend these movement ideas to create a dance sequence
*  using their own words and learnt dance terminology to share ideas about the dance they are creating and recognising and accepting constructive feedback from peers or teachers; for example, in response to a “work-in-progress” sharing

### Presenting and performing {#presenting-and-performing}

##### AC9ADA2P01 {#ac9ada2p01}

share dance sequences in informal settings

**Elaborations**
*  presenting a learned sequence of movements or performing dances they have learnt to peers and teachers
*  performing a dance they have co-created with a First Nations Australian person who has cultural authority, and following protocols to ensure they are using any Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property with permission
*  expressing ideas to an audience through movement; for example, showing contrasting dynamics by stamping heavily and tip­toeing lightly or using movement qualities, such as slow controlled sinking to the floor to express melting ice or sharp jerky movement to express a robot
*  using Viewpoints to develop questions when responding to dances they experience in order to reflect on their choreography and/or performance; for example, “What did this dance make you think about?”, “Did the dance movements remind you of anything?”, “How did you communicate the ideas or intention in this dance?”
