# Visual Arts - Years 1 and 2 {#visual-arts-years-1-and-2}

## Level Description {#level-description}

In this band, learning in The Arts builds on each student’s prior learning and experiences. Students continue to learn through purposeful and creative play in structured learning programs designed to foster a strong sense of wellbeing, and develop their connection with and contribution to the world. They work individually and in collaboration with peers and teachers, drawing on their imaginations, works of fiction, real-life experiences and learnings from across the curriculum to support their engagement in arts learning, as artists and as audiences.

Students explore artworks that they experience at home, school and/or through family and community events. They connect with visual artists who live and work in the community; for example, by visiting arts spaces or exploring artworks and experiences such as virtual performances or exhibitions. They use stimulus materials such as images, events, texts, questions and observations as inspiration for their own visual arts practice. These experiences support students to develop aesthetic knowledge across cognitive, sensory, emotive and physical domains, and to value artworks and practices across cultures, communities and/or other contexts.

In this band, the focus is on students:

1.  exploring and responding to
    *   artworks, artists’ practices and arts experiences across cultures, communities and/or other contexts, using visual arts practices and inquiry
    *   examples of artworks and arts practices of First Nations Australians
2.  developing creative and critical practices and skills
    *   creative practices for using visual conventions, visual arts processes and materials
    *   critical practices for observing, reflecting on and responding to artworks and practices they experience, including their own visual arts practice
3.  creating artworks in a range of 2D, 3D and/or 4D (time-based) forms using available materials and/or digital tools
4.  presenting/sharing artworks in informal settings such as classroom presentations.

### Exploring and responding {#exploring-and-responding}

##### AC9AVA2E01 {#ac9ava2e01}

explore where, why and how people across cultures, communities and/or other contexts experience visual arts

**Elaborations**
*  investigating a diverse range of artworks made by living Australian artists; for example, artworks from a local, national, state or regional collection
*  exploring when, where, how and why First Nations Australians use visual arts, crafts and designs to share knowledge about cultures; for example, during celebrations such as Aboriginal Children's Week, NAIDOC week, Reconciliation Week or to acknowledge significant occasions such as Sorry Day
*  using Viewpoints to co-develop questions to explore and investigate ideas and understandings about artworks, craft works or designs; for example, “What do I think is the story in this artwork?”, “What do I recognise in this artwork?”
*  using Viewpoints to co-develop questions to explore an artist and their practice; for example, “Who is the artist?”, “When and where was this artwork created?”, “What materials and techniques might this artist have used?”
*  identifying similarities and differences in artworks that represent subject matter or ideas they may be exploring in other learning areas; for example, exploring artworks that represent significant events from different times such as celebrations, or subject matter such as living creatures and their relationships with their environment

##### AC9AVA2E02 {#ac9ava2e02}

explore examples of visual arts created by First Nations Australians

**Elaborations**
*  exploring how artworks created by First Nations Australian artists feature places as a way to show us why where we are is a part of who we are
*  identifying where they might experience First Nations Australians’ cultural expressions in their lives and communities and as part of state and national events, taking notice of ways that artists observe protocols and respect Elders or knowledge holders
*  listening to the voices of First Nations Australian artists as they describe the importance of Country/Place to their art-making; for example, through direct engagement or using resources created or co-created by First Nations Australians
*  observing how visual conventions are used in artworks and designs created by First Nations Australians; for example, exploring colours, symbols and patterns used in artworks with representatives of the First Nations Australian community or through resources that are created or co-created by First Nations Australians
*  exploring artworks that represent First Nations Australians’ interpretations of the night sky, co-creating symbols and/or designs to represent shapes and patterns that can be seen at different times of the year with First Nations Australians who have cultural authority

### Developing practices and skills {#developing-practices-and-skills}

##### AC9AVA2D01 {#ac9ava2d01}

experiment and play with visual conventions, visual arts processes and materials

**Elaborations**
*  playing with a range of natural and/or constructed materials to experiment with visual conventions and visual arts processes; for example, creating mud sculptures, or using sticks, leaves and playdough to explore texture
*  unpacking a surprise bag of everyday tools and materials, and working silently in small groups to make something within limitations; for example, using materials of only one colour or making sculptural forms from paper or cardboard using only folding and tearing processes
*  using Viewpoints to develop questions to reflect on their arts experiences; for example, “What was challenging about working in a limited timeframe?”, “What was something new that I discovered about the material?”, “What failures led to new discoveries?”
*  identifying the difference between open lines and closed shapes; digitally filling a selection or colour block using a collage of closed shapes to form silhouettes of recognisable objects, people or other living things
*  examining artworks and trialling “layer + layer + layer” as a way of building surfaces, colour, texture and interest; for example, experimenting to create a layered world with pastels, then watercolour, ink and wax, and once the experiment is completed, identifying how each material could be used in a future artwork
*  exploring visual conventions using a wide range of materials; for example, creating lines using media such as pastels, chalk, paint, ripped paper, textiles and markers; or going on a “line hunt” to identify and photograph the different lines they see around their school environment using a digital camera, or creating rubbings

### Creating and making {#creating-and-making}

##### AC9AVA2C01 {#ac9ava2c01}

use visual conventions, visual arts processes and materials to create artworks

**Elaborations**
*  using a combination of chaotic/accidental mark-making with more detailed intentional mark-making; for example, using blobs of paint with added outlines and detail, and using imagination and creativity to build on the shapes to see what emerges
*  using Viewpoints to develop questions as they experiment with arrangement and rearrangement to shuffle visual conventions, subject matter and materials around a designated area and to deliberately change the meaning of a visual story; for example, “What happens if I make the subject fill the page?” or “Can I change the meaning of my work by using darker or lighter tones?”
*  using visual brainstorming to build ideas for artworks and using Viewpoints to develop questions to push ideas further; for example, “What happens if I combine these ideas?”, “How can I adapt this idea?”, “What happens if I remove part of this design?”
*  creating a relief print through nature-printing, or creating collagraphs by creating a raised textured surface by using glue, thread/string and textured paper to create monoprints; cutting these shapes out and making a collage to create a recognisable form, such as a face or an animal
*  using 3D construction (sculpture) methods to represent subject matter or ideas being explored in another learning area; for example, building on their understanding of living things as a starting point to use modelling materials such as potato clay and found objects to represent the life cycle of an insect
*  using a combination of digital art and analog art-making, such as using photography or drawing apps for painting and drawing, to create a collaged abstract work that represents feelings and emotions; for example, responding with colour, line and shape to music to create work that communicates how the music makes them feel

### Presenting and performing {#presenting-and-performing}

##### AC9AVA2P01 {#ac9ava2p01}

share artworks and/or visual arts practice in informal settings

**Elaborations**
*  presenting an artwork they have made to the class, a small group or their teacher and explaining what they like about it
*  creating a spontaneous and experimental artwork and only showing a small portion of it to their audience as they dramatise the making of the work; or using unlikely objects for brushes, testing colours and “brush” strokes using expressive movements, and applying a cardboard “window” frame as a flourish across the finished painting to find the most “successful section”, trimming away the remainder and concluding the performance by cutting a “window frame” from paper to frame their final selection for display
*  using an everyday object as the starting point, drawing the object, then personifying it by adding character qualities, attributes and a name; then taking it in turns to match each student’s artwork with the appropriate object, explaining how they arrived at their decision
*  deciding on an appropriate audience and ways to share their artworks; for example, sharing with the class a work-in-progress or posting their work on a school learning management system to allow their families to see and appreciate it
