# Visual Arts - Years 5 and 6 {#visual-arts-years-5-and-6}

## Level Description {#level-description}

In this band, students continue to learn in and through the practices of The Arts subjects, building on their prior learning and experiences. They work creatively and purposefully and continue to develop their connection with and contribution to the world as artists and as audiences. They work individually and in collaboration with peers and teachers.

Students engage with artworks, artists, practices across cultures, times, places and/or other contexts; for example, exploring artworks, arts spaces and practices in their local area, state/territory or a country or region of Asia. They take opportunities to engage with living artists and their works; for example, by visiting arts spaces or exploring artworks and experiences such as exhibitions available through online sources. They continue to use stimulus materials such as images, events, texts, questions and observations as inspiration for their visual arts practice. These experiences support students to develop aesthetic knowledge across cognitive, sensory, emotive and physical domains, and to value artworks and practices from diverse cultures.

In this band, the focus is on students:

1.  exploring and responding to
    *   artworks from local, regional, national and global cultures, times, places and/or other contexts that show how artists communicate ideas, perspectives and/or meaning through their visual arts practice
    *   artworks and visual arts practices that showcase ways that First Nations Australians are continuing and revitalising cultures
2.  developing creative and critical practices and skills
    *   creative practices for using visual conventions, visual arts processes and materials
    *   critical practices by observing, reflecting on and responding to artworks and practices they experience, including their own visual arts practice
3.  creating artworks in a range of 2D, 3D and/or 4D (time-based) forms using available materials and/or digital tools
4.  presenting artworks and practices in available informal and/or formal settings, including, as appropriate, school-hosted digital spaces such as a school learning management system.

## Strands {#strands}

### Exploring and responding {#exploring-and-responding}

##### AC9AVA6E01 {#ac9ava6e01}

explore ways that visual conventions, visual arts processes and materials are combined to communicate ideas, perspectives and/or meaning in visual arts across cultures, times, places and/or other contexts

**Elaborations**
*  investigating how a diverse range of Australian artists have expressed historical, social and environmental concerns over time; for example, artists who have migrated to Australia at different times who represent their experiences through their artworks and visual arts practice, using Viewpoints to develop questions such as, “What does this artwork tell us about the impact of this person/culture on society?”, “What can I learn about this person’s experiences, or about what it means to be Australian?”
*  identifying ways that artworks by different artists can present multiple perspectives of the same event, discussing how these works can assist the development of social awareness; for example, accessing and comparing responses to artworks that depict the colonisation of Australia by the British from the perspective of a First Nations Australian person, a person with links to the British colonists, or a person with no cultural links to either of these groups
*  exploring a range of Australian and international artworks, such as artworks from countries or regions in Asia, that communicate a topic or issue the class is learning about in another subject, and individually expressing their own views of the issue in a series of sequential visual panels without any text
*  using Viewpoints to develop questions to examine, compare and contrast what they notice in an artwork; for example, as a class, critically navigating multiple perspectives of the same artwork and questioning why they see these works so differently
*  examining audio descriptions as an accessible way for people with impaired vision to enjoy visual arts; for example, listening to a series of descriptions of artworks by Australian artists in Australian institutions, selecting an artwork that they are interested in and creating an audio description of their own

##### AC9AVA6E02 {#ac9ava6e02}

explore ways that First Nations Australians use visual arts to continue and revitalise cultures

**Elaborations**
*  exploring the ways that a diverse range of First Nations Australian artists embed themselves and their communities in artworks in a range of representative forms as a visual declaration of identity, storytelling and resilience; for example, exploring representations of First Nations Australians as superheroes in comics and popular culture
*  exploring the ways that visual arts created by First Nations Australians may have multiple purposes; for example, art as cultural practice, art to communicate cultural understandings, or as narrative
*  investigating a range of site-specific artworks created by First Nations Australian artists, exploring how they communicate and celebrate cultural knowledge and understandings; for example, street artworks, murals and installations
*  using Viewpoints to question understandings about artists and artworks, and explore what needs to be investigated further, such as “What do I already know about this artist?”, “What do I need to learn to have a better understanding about this artist, their Country/Place and culture?”, “What knowledge can I share with others?”, “What questions would I ask the artist about this artwork?”
*  investigating how meaning and purpose are communicated in artworks and design created or co-created by First Nations Australians; for example, learning about how visual conventions are used in artworks and designs, such as textiles and fashion, to share cultural knowledge with the broader community

### Developing practices and skills {#developing-practices-and-skills}

##### AC9AVA6D01 {#ac9ava6d01}

experiment with, document and reflect on ways to use a range of visual conventions, visual arts processes, and materials

**Elaborations**
*  drawing on themes they are learning about in other subjects and visually brainstorming a range of diverse ideas that link to this theme; for example, using Viewpoints to develop questions to reflect on and extend the concept such as, “What are examples of this concept?”, “How can I make this more specific, or broaden my approach?”, “What are my experiences of this?” and exploring how they can use visual conventions and visual arts processes to create a composition to communicate these ideas visually
*  using visual conventions and visual arts processes to map the movements of a dance sequence, indicating, for example, the shapes dancers make with their bodies, use of levels (low–high), the directions of travelling steps or ways of moving (smooth, jerky, confined, stretchy), and using these to create an abstract visual representation of the dance; for example, using Viewpoints to develop questions to reflect on how colour, tone and composition can be manipulated to express the mood and emotions communicated and experienced in the dance performance ("How can I communicate to the viewer the energy and passion experienced in the dance?")
*  presenting a selection of Augmented Reality face filters that map and track the face in real time; for example, identifying three main types of assets such as face tracker, face mesh, canvas frame, and using face mesh resources to create a digital or analog concept for a face filter that communicates an intended concept; and exploring options for use, such as in a drama they are creating
*  exploring a range of approaches to printmaking, such as transferring previously created drawings onto printing foam and creating multiple prints that explore visual conventions; for example, using different coloured inks or paints, gradually adding pattern and texture to increase the complexity of detail, cutting out and combining aspects of prints and other 2D media to explore a collaborative approach
*  making informed choices about using various combinations of representational elements appropriate for a concept or subject matter; for example, exploring and reflecting on observational and gestural drawing processes as different ways to describe an object or figure, or combining materials such as imaginative drawing over realistic photographs to elaborate on and create new meaning
*  exploring different approaches to working in 3D forms, such as developing a range of techniques in modelling using materials such as earthenware clay or modelling clay; developing skills in hand-building and surface decoration to reflect on ways to communicate ideas, subject matter and meaning

### Creating and making {#creating-and-making}

##### AC9AVA6C01 {#ac9ava6c01}

use visual conventions, visual arts processes and materials to plan and create artworks that communicate ideas, perspectives and/or meaning

**Elaborations**
*  applying their understanding of visual arts processes and materials to create artworks that are both robust and communicate intended aesthetic qualities; for example, using a range of joining techniques to create a sculptural construction using cardboard and textiles, or carefully considering the use of joining techniques in creating an environmental sculpture using natural materials designed to break down and disintegrate over time
*  using visual conventions and visual arts processes to communicate ideas and meaning in their artwork; for example, exploring the ways that different brushstrokes can communicate meaning in a painting, such as long, smooth horizontal blended lines in a watercolour wash contrasted with textural brushstrokes with thick paint in contrasting colour
*  examining a series of diverse artworks that employ frames, windows, mirrors or sections as containers or portals into space, and using this tool as inspiration to create three versions or ideas for an artwork; for example, creating different sized frames to view the world around them and creating compositions for artworks, considering how they can include frames within frames
*  trying and testing a range of analog visual arts materials, such as paints, drawing materials or clay, and comparing virtual simulations of these materials; entering their findings in a logbook and using findings to create an artwork that combines at least one virtual material and one analog material
*  creating artworks that are the product of ideas they have developed through experimentation and planning; making choices about how to use visual art conventions, materials and techniques that best communicate their intentions
*  forming modular patterns, images or letters with grid paper or an online digital system to combine glyphs, pixels and shapes; for example, removing the grid and transforming it to another form such as a poster or template for printmaking

### Presenting and performing {#presenting-and-performing}

##### AC9AVA6P01 {#ac9ava6p01}

select and present documentation of visual arts practice, and display artworks in informal and/or formal settings

**Elaborations**
*  preparing artworks for display within the school environment; for example, measuring and making frames or stands for artworks, using repurposed/recycled materials, measuring artworks and spaces between so that, for example, they have an identical height from the floor and are spaced at equal distances; writing and positioning written labels for each artwork with information about the work and the artist; and considering the best way to arrange the space to engage the audience
*  exploring digital methods of encoding information in artworks to share with audiences; for example, by using image coding software or QR codes
*  working collaboratively to create an online exhibition of student work; for example, on a school learning management system.
*  exploring options for sharing work in public spaces; for example, in café galleries, public exhibition spaces or through community arts events
*  selecting and arranging evidence of their learning from their investigations, experiments and reflections in a way that communicates the development of their ideas and understandings, and sharing this with their teacher
*  considering artworks that represent a spatial awareness in digital or physical forms; for example, experimenting with Augmented Reality to place collage, objects or forms in space as a layer over what we see as “reality” digitally, or by arranging objects in physical space with transparent attachments, and producing a short moving image work to map how the visual assets change depending on point of view of the audience
*  creating a set of art labels to accompany artworks in a class exhibition of student work; for example, labels that inform audiences about the artist and their intentions, an exhibition introduction, advertising material and reviews
