# Visual Arts - Years 3 and 4 {#visual-arts-years-3-and-4}

## Level Description {#level-description}

In this band, learning in The Arts builds on each student’s prior learning and experiences. Arts learning in this band continues to use purposeful and creative play-based activities that foster development of students’ identity and wellbeing, and their connection with and contribution to the world. Students further develop their capability and confidence in using subject-specific skills, and creative and critical practices. They work individually and in collaboration with peers and teachers.

Students continue to explore artworks that they experience at home, school or through family and community event. They connect with visual artists who live and work in the community; for example, by visiting arts spaces and/or exploring artworks and experiences such as virtual exhibitions. They use stimulus materials such as images, events, texts, questions and observations as inspiration for their own visual arts practice. These experiences support students to develop aesthetic knowledge across cognitive, sensory, emotive and physical domains, and to value artworks and practices from across cultures, times, places and/or other contexts such as countries or cultures in Asia.

In this band, the focus is on students:

1.  exploring and responding to
    *   artworks and experiences that showcase where, why and/or how visual arts are created across cultures, times, places and/or other contexts.
    *   examples of artworks created by First Nations Australians that communicate connection to and responsibility for Country/Place
2.  developing creative and critical practices and skills
    *   creative practices for using visual conventions, visual arts processes and materials
    *   critical practices by observing, reflecting on and responding to artworks and visual arts practices they experience, including their own visual arts practice
3.  creating artworks in a range of 2D, 3D and/or 4D (time-based) forms using available materials (including available digital tools)
4.  presenting/sharing artworks in informal settings such as spaces within the school.

### Exploring and responding {#exploring-and-responding}

##### AC9AVA4E01 {#ac9ava4e01}

explore where, why and how visual arts are created and/or presented across cultures, times, places and/or other contexts

**Elaborations**
*  exploring a diverse range of artworks created by artists working collaboratively and brainstorming the reasons why artists might choose to work as a team, and then comparing their ideas with information the artists have shared about their collaborative practice
*  exploring artists’ practice by sourcing information created or co-created by the artist and using Viewpoints to develop questions to develop understanding of the practices, such as “What does the artists’ studio or space look like?”, “How do they develop their ideas?”, “What are they doing when they are developing and trialling their techniques and working with materials?”, “How do they engage with galleries (physical or virtual) to exhibit their work?”
*  observing and exploring details such as use of materials, patterns, proportions or familiar features in artworks and using Viewpoints to co-create questions such as, “What is the artwork made of?”, “How can I look more closely at this work to see something I did not notice the first time?”, “What do I see when I look at the work through half-shut eyes?”, “How does the work look like it feels, and how does it actually feel?”
*  making connections and comparisons between artists working across cultures, times and/or places; for example, finding similarities and differences between the ways that an artist’s context impacts their approach to a theme such as sustainability or community celebrations, or finding similarities and differences between the ways that different artists approach the same material and techniques, such as different approaches to creating sustainable sculpture using found objects, natural and human-made materials
*  exploring ways to represent the world as they see it; for example, using ideas and experience about a recent event (such as a sports or cultural event or celebration) and making an artwork that communicates their perspective of the event; and then identifying how their work is different from the works created by other students in the class, how the teacher’s work differs from the students’ work or how their works compare to works by other artists that feature similar subject matter
*  identifying ways that artworks by different artists can present multiple perspectives of the same event and discussing how these works can develop social awareness; for example, accessing and comparing artists and artworks that explore sustainability, such as land art, artworks using recycled materials that represent the effects of climate on the environment
*  describing and categorising visual features and cultural works around the school, such as artworks, craft works, design or architectural features, memorials, murals or displays according to their purpose; for example, social, decorative, architectural, functional, cultural

##### AC9AVA4E02 {#ac9ava4e02}

explore how First Nations Australians use visual arts to communicate their connection to and responsibility for Country/Place

**Elaborations**
*  looking at visual artworks that represent the importance of Country/Place and Story for First Nations Australians as a starting point for talking about different ways of seeing the same place and telling stories
*  accessing examples of contemporary First Nations Australian artists’ ideas about Country/Place through cultural expressions; for example, works that express spiritual and intellectual connections to the land, sea, sky and waterways, and using Viewpoints to develop questions about the work, such as, “Who are the artists and on what Country was the work created?”, “What can I learn from the artists about this work?”, “What does this work make me think about my own connections to significant places?”
*  examining a diverse range of symbols and emblems and learning from people with cultural authority about their importance to First Nations Australians’ identity and culture
*  exploring topics in other learning areas, such as the diversity of Nations, by examining a diverse range of cultural expressions or artworks of and by First Nations Australian artists in order to learn from the artists what the works teach us about the subject matter; for example, using Viewpoints to develop questions that explore what is important to them, their identity, stories and their communities, such as, “How does this work represent identity?”, “Are there place-based narratives in this artwork?”, “What do we see?” or ‘What have we learnt that makes us think this?”
*  considering what their own cultural connections are as individuals; for example, considering place, language, family customs, values and beliefs and how, as an artist, they can use Viewpoints questions to map ways to use visual arts processes, subject matter and visual conventions to create artworks that communicate their personal connection to place. A typical question is, “Where do I feel most connected to my family, and what symbols, colours, shapes and subject matter could I create to represent this connection?”
*  exploring visual conventions, symbols or patterns with representatives of a First Nations Australian community, or resources that are created or co-created by First Nations Australians; for example, exploring artworks that share cultural accounts of Country/Place

### Developing practices and skills {#developing-practices-and-skills}

##### AC9AVA4D01 {#ac9ava4d01}

experiment with a range of ways to use visual conventions, visual arts processes and materials

**Elaborations**
*  exploring the ways that artists use composition by observing space and balance within an artwork; for example, using transparent material or digital tools layered over a diverse selection of artworks to outline the dominant forms and divisions of space, such as foreground and background, positive and negative space or areas of emphasis, and using this outline as the basis for the composition of a new artwork
*  exploring materials based on visual conventions; for example, creating a tactile (texture) board from a collection of materials and objects, brainstorming adjectives to describe the textures and/or collecting samples of colours they connect with and inventing new names for those colours that are meaningful to them; then using Viewpoints to develop questions that explore the diversity of responses
*  working within limits to explore and experiment with the properties of materials; for example, playing a game to find different ways of creating lines with a wide range of materials in a timed period, and then comparing their results; or finding different ways of using a limited set of materials, such as cardboard and chenille sticks, to create a sculpture
*  learning to use visual arts language when describing and documenting their thinking and learning; for example, developing questions based on Viewpoints, and using arrows and short statements to annotate their visual experiments (“What media did I use?”, “What worked well?”, “What went wrong, and how could I explore other options next time?”) or creating a sound file of their learning and thinking to accompany their experimentations when they present “work-in-progress”
*  manipulating and experimenting with combinations of various materials and technologies to create visual effects; for example, using crosshatching to create tone, or using design elements to focus the viewer’s attention on a composition and using Viewpoints to reflect on the effectiveness of their experimentation ("What was I trying to achieve?", "What did I learn from pushing the boundaries of the materials and processes?")

### Creating and making {#creating-and-making}

##### AC9AVA4C01 {#ac9ava4c01}

use visual conventions, visual arts processes and materials to create artworks that communicate ideas, perspectives and/or meaning

**Elaborations**
*  drawing on a selection of topics they may be exploring in other subjects, mind-mapping some ideas that link to these topics, using Viewpoints to explore multiple possibilities such as, “What are my questions about this topic?”, “What visual conventions could communicate ideas about this topic?”, “What do I already know about this?”, extending the ideas to arrive at 3 compositional ideas, selecting one idea, documenting their reasons for the selection and making the artwork
*  exploring tools and awareness of measured and freeform perspectives; for example, using digital and/or analog tools to reference a special place near their school, and dividing the scene, surface or paper into foreground, middle ground and background sections to consider how to create depth in their artwork
*  creating a visual artwork inspired by a performance that can become a part of the performance or the setting for a situation; for example, creating an abstract painting that documents the lines, movement and gestures in a dance, or illustrating a scene from a devised drama
*  considering how as artists they can communicate perspectives to viewers through the use of visual conventions and visual arts processes in the way that an illustrator represents ideas in a text to communicate aspects of the story, and applying this to their own work; for example, by re-reading a section of a familiar text as a class, discussing multiple ideas for illustrating the scene and perspectives in the text, creating their own work and comparing their approach to others’ approaches
*  using Viewpoints to develop questions as they experiment with composition to arrange visual conventions, subject matter and materials based on a designated area and deliberately changing the meaning of a visual story; for example, “What happens if I make the subject fill the frame?”, “Can I change the meaning of my work by using darker or lighter tones?”
*  combining their understanding of visual conventions and visual arts processes to create different meaning in an artwork; for example, using a range of 2D media such as charcoal and coloured pastels to create gradation of tone in their artwork and using Viewpoints to develop questions as they work, such as “In what ways can I use colour to change the feeling of this artwork?”, “How does using darker tones contrasting with lighter ones create an illusion of depth?”

### Presenting and performing {#presenting-and-performing}

##### AC9AVA4P01 {#ac9ava4p01}

share and/or display artworks and/or visual arts practice in informal settings

**Elaborations**
*  selecting examples from their visual arts practice (for example, experimentation with materials and processes or different compositional approaches for a final artwork) and arranging these in a visual display to share the development of their ideas
*  deciding on appropriate ways to share their artworks and their learning; for example, including experiments and self-reflections in folios or visual diaries for assessment, demonstrating progress being made via peer circle shares in class; and deciding on appropriate audiences, such as decorative or communicative exhibitions/displays for the school community, social media posts for the broader community
*  trialling different ways of presenting artworks in different locations; for example, presenting a school wall display of artworks, considering what might need to change so that it can be shared on a digital platform such as the school learning management system
*  discussing and documenting the ideas, themes and meaning/s of their artwork; for example, taking the form of a written or spoken artist statement, and exploring different ways of presenting their artwork and artist statement (possibly via multimedia)
*  identifying and explaining their own and other artists' choices in art-making, including visual arts processes, visual conventions and materials
