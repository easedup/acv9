# Visual Arts - Years 9 and 10 {#visual-arts-years-9-and-10}

## Level Description {#level-description}

In this band, learning in Visual Arts continues to build on each student’s prior learning and experiences as students develop their capability and confidence across the practices of Visual Arts. They continue to use visual conventions, visual arts processes and materials in purposeful and creative ways that are informed by their engagement with the work of living visual artists, visual arts practices and arts spaces in local, regional, national and global contexts such as countries or regions in Asia, including use of visual arts in multi-arts, trans-disciplinary or hybrid forms. This awareness of the diversity of visual arts practices, forms, styles and representations informs their own visual arts practice. They work collaboratively with peers and teachers.

In this band, the focus is on students:

1.  exploring and responding to
    *   artworks and visual arts practices from across cultures, times, places and/or other contexts; for example, through exploration of works in physical or virtual spaces or engagement with artists
    *   ways artworks created by First Nations Australians celebrate and challenge multiple perspectives of Australian identity
2.  developing practices and skills
    *   building and extending creative practices and skills for visual arts practice, developing ideas and intentions, creating representations, and developing skills and techniques in specific visual arts processes
    *   building and extending critical practices by taking opportunities to reflect, evaluate or respond to their own work and the work of others; for example, considering how to apply knowledge of visual arts practices in their work
3.  creating artworks to communicate ideas, perspectives and meaning in 2D, 3D and/or 4D (time-based forms) and/or multi-disciplinary forms to communicate ideas and intentions using visual arts practices and materials
4.  presenting artworks and practices to audiences; for example, curating exhibits of their work, as individual artists or by working collaboratively. This can include designing and preparing a space or developing supporting material such as artist statements.

### Exploring and responding {#exploring-and-responding}

##### AC9AVA10E01 {#ac9ava10e01}

investigate the ways that artists across cultures, times, places and/or other contexts develop personal expression in their visual arts practice to represent, communicate and/or challenge ideas, perspectives and/or meaning

**Elaborations**
*  analysing a selection of artworks that represent a point of view on the same or similar theme, story, historical event, place, time, use of a technique or materials, noting the differences and similarities in the range of artworks and how an artist’s lived experience and cultural forces can have an impact on perspectives found in their work
*  investigating how linear timelines, in contrast to circular timelines, can shift meaning in art with reference to First Nations Australian ways of knowing, being and doing
*  researching, analysing and evaluating the ways that artists from different times and places represent subject matter, themes or concepts, such as portraiture, freedom and social change or identity, using a range of styles and conventions
*  creating extended written, oral or multimedia accounts, such as essays, pod/vodcast, debate or reviews, that discuss and explain how artists have represented their ideas in their artworks and artist practices
*  selecting different critical viewpoints to develop explanations about artists’ approaches and works at different times and in different contexts
*  exploring the development of a visual arts form over time, considering the impact of globalisation, cultural practices, and new discoveries in materials and technologies; for example, wood block printing or photography

##### AC9AVA10E02 {#ac9ava10e02}

investigate the ways that First Nations Australian artists celebrate and challenge multiple perspectives of Australian identity through their artworks and visual arts practice

**Elaborations**
*  researching a diverse range of artworks or designs such as artworks in galleries, protest posters or street art in order to analyse how and why First Nations Australian artists have used visual communication as a tool to express activism for change
*  analysing the ways that First Nations Australian artists use their practices to challenge and inform community debate and present multiple ways of understanding an issue; for example, understandings about “first contacts” between the First Nations Peoples of Australia and people from Britain or Europe
*  comparing, analysing and evaluating ways that contemporary First Nations Australian artists and designers are exploring and challenging concepts and histories of Australia and Australian identity

### Developing practices and skills {#developing-practices-and-skills}

##### AC9AVA10D01 {#ac9ava10d01}

experiment with visual conventions, visual arts processes and materials to refine skills and develop personal expression

**Elaborations**
*  experimenting with the material properties of a medium or form and investigating/exploring, in depth, the technical processes associated with that form in order to develop a comprehensive understanding of the ways that they can use it to represent their ideas in their own visual arts practice
*  interrogating multiple ways of approaching an activity; for example, using a diverse range of media to express different interpretations of the one topic, such as producing several sketches of the one object using different media with each one exploring a different emotion
*  investigating a diverse selection of artists through their sketchbooks to uncover their practices, and find connections between their processes and the development of their personal expression
*  developing an “inspiration” journal of collections from everyday life, such as photographs, found objects, experiments with media, thoughts and ideas, and using questions based on Viewpoints to interrogate their “inspiration” journal and begin identifying their own personal style; for example, "What am I drawn to, and why is this important to me?"
*  documenting and evaluating their investigations of visual art processes, visual conventions and materials in a diary, portfolio or digital journal; for example, annotating the processes used and using Viewpoints to develop questions to deepen their understanding of the concepts explored or processes used, such as "Have I pushed and explored this idea, medium or technique as far as I can?", "What is the problem, and how can I find multiple possible solutions?", "What happens when I …?”, “What did I learn from this …?”, “How can it inform my future art-making?"
*  drawing lines, shapes and arrows drawn over photocopies of artworks and using a code to demonstrate their understanding of the way the artist has composed the artwork to communicate meaning; for example, using lines to trace over an artwork to show composition techniques, such as rule of thirds, creating movement using diagonal and or curved lines, repetition and pattern, or the use of visual hierarchy to indicate how the viewer’s eye follows the layout of a designed product

##### AC9AVA10D02 {#ac9ava10d02}

reflect on the way they and other visual artists respond to influences to inspire, develop and resolve choices they make in their own visual arts practice

**Elaborations**
*  investigating and reflecting on the role and influence of their own culture, family or personal experiences when developing ideas for artworks
*  investigating a diverse range of visual artists; for example, artists who live and work in a different place, such as a country in the Asia region, and reflecting on accounts of them discussing influences on their work and practices, in order to develop an understanding of the many factors that can shape their own visual arts practice
*  analysing and reflecting on the ways that artists have structured their artworks to represent ideas; for example, using Viewpoints to generate questions to facilitate their understanding of the artists’ intentions
*  reflecting on, evaluating and resolving their choices for representing their ideas as their work progresses; for example, through informal discussions or reviews, or in written/oral/multimedia evaluations, such as journals
*  exploring current issues that are of importance to them, such as global or local issues, as a starting point for generating and reflecting on ideas for artworks that explore themes/concepts such as sustainable futures, wellbeing and emotional health, or human rights issues
*  investigating the ways that artists use their visual arts practice to explore, examine, resolve or represent personal experiences and expressions as a starting point to understand how they can use their own visual arts practice to explore and respectfully/safely represent personal issues, such as self-awareness, emotional awareness and personal wellbeing

### Creating and making {#creating-and-making}

##### AC9AVA10C01 {#ac9ava10c01}

## Achievement Standards {#achievement-standards}

By the end of Year 10, students analyse how and why visual conventions, visual arts processes and materials are manipulated in artworks they create and/or experience. They evaluate how and why artists from across cultures, times, places and/or other contexts use visual conventions, visual arts processes and materials in their visual arts practice and/or artworks to represent and/or challenge ideas, perspectives and/or meaning. They evaluate how visual arts are used to celebrate and challenge perspectives of Australian identity.
Students draw on inspiration from multiple sources to generate and develop ideas for artworks. They document and reflect on their own visual arts practice. They use knowledge of visual conventions, visual arts processes and materials to create artworks that represent and/or communicate ideas, perspectives and/or meaning. They curate and present exhibitions of their own and or/others’ artworks and visual arts practice to engage audiences.
