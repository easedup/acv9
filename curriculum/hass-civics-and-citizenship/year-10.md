# Civics and Citizenship - Year 10 {#civics-and-citizenship-year-10}

## Level Description {#level-description}

In Year 10, students compare Australia’s federal system of government with another system of government in a country in Asia. Students examine Australia’s roles and responsibilities within the international context, such as its involvement with the United Nations and responses to global issues. Students also study the purpose and work of the High Court. They examine how rights are protected in Australia, and investigate the values and practices that enable a democratic society to be sustained. Students reflect on their rights, privileges and responsibilities as active and informed citizens.

Inquiry questions provide a framework for developing students’ knowledge, understanding and skills. The following inquiry questions are examples only and may be used or adapted to suit local contexts:

*   How is Australia’s democracy defined and shaped by the global context?
*   How are government policies shaped by Australia’s international legal obligations?
*   What are the functions of the High Court of Australia and how does it protect rights under the Constitution?
*   What are the features of a resilient democracy?
*   How does Australia respond to emerging global issues?
