# Civics and Citizenship - Year 9 {#civics-and-citizenship-year-9}

## Level Description {#level-description}

In Year 9, students further develop their understanding of Australia’s federal system of government and how it enables change. Students investigate the features and jurisdictions of Australia’s court system, including its role in applying and interpreting Australian law. They also examine global connectedness and how this is shaping contemporary Australian society and global citizenship.

Inquiry questions provide a framework for developing students’ knowledge, understanding and skills. The following inquiry questions are examples only and may be used or adapted to suit local contexts:

*   What are the influences that shape change in the operation of Australia's political and legal systems?
*   How does Australia's court system work in support of a democratic and just society?
*   How do citizens participate in an interconnected world?
