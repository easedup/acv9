## General Capabilities

The 7 general capabilities in the Australian Curriculum are: 
- Critical and Creative Thinking 
- Digital Literacy 
- Ethical Understanding 
- Intercultural Understanding 
- Literacy 
- Numeracy 
- Personal and Social capability.

In the Australian Curriculum, general capabilities are addressed through the content of the learning areas; they are not separate learning areas, subjects or isolated skills. The teaching of learning area content will be strengthened by the application of relevant general capabilities, as will the development of the general capabilities through appropriate learning area contexts.  

Opportunities to develop general capabilities in learning area content vary. Some general capabilities are essential to, and best developed within, specific learning areas; others support learning in any learning area. General capabilities are identified in content descriptions where they are developed or applied through learning area content. They are also identified in content elaborations where they offer opportunities to add depth and richness to student learning.  

In the learning areas of the Australian Curriculum, general capabilities are identified, using icons, where they are developed or applied in the content descriptions and elaborations.

##### Number and place value

This sub-element describes how a student becomes increasingly able to recognise, read, represent, order and interpret numbers within our place value number system, expressed in different ways. It outlines key understandings needed to process, communicate and interpret quantitative information in a variety of contexts.

**Level 1**
*   Numeral recognition and identification
*   identifies and produces familiar number names and numerals such as those associated with age or home address, but may not distinguish whether they refer to a quantity, an ordinal position or a label (e.g. "I am \(5\) and my sister is \(7\)"; "I wear the number \(7\) jumper"; "I live at \(4\) Baker Street"; "this is the number \(2\)")
*   Pre-place value
*   compares \(2\) collections visually and states which group has more items and which group has less
*   instantly recognises collections up to \(3\) without needing to count and recognises small quantities as being the same or different
*   uses language to describe order and place (e.g. understands "who wants to go first?"; in the middle; "who was the last person to read this book?")

**Level 2**
*   Numeral recognition and identification
*   identifies and names numerals in the range of \(1–10\) (e.g. when asked "which is \(3\)?" points to the numeral \(3\); when shown the numeral \(5\), says "that’s \(5\)")
*   matches a quantity of items in a collection to the correct number name or numeral in the range of \(1–10\) (e.g. when shown the numeral \(5\) and asked to "go and collect this many items", gathers \(5\) items)
*   identifies standard number configurations such as on standard dice or dominos and in other arrangements up to \(6\), using subitising (e.g. moves a counter the correct number of places on a board game based on the roll of a dice; recognises a collection of \(5\) items by perceptually subitising \(3\) and \(2\))
*   Developing place value
*   orders numbers represented by numerals to at least \(10\) (e.g. uses number cards, or a number track and places the numerals \(1–10\) in the correct order)
*   indicates the greater or lesser of \(2\) numbers represented by numerals in the range from one to \(10\) (e.g. when shown the numerals \(6\) and \(3\), identifies \(3\) as representing the lesser amount)
*   identifies smaller collections within collections to \(10\) such as numbers represented in non-standard number configurations (e.g. recognises \(7\) dots represented in a non-standard configuration by perceptually subitising \(4\) and \(3\); represents numbers less than \(10\) using five- and ten-frames)
*   demonstrates that one \(10\) is the same as \(10\) ones (e.g. uses physical and virtual materials such as ten-frames and bundles of \(10\))

**Level 3**
*   Numeral recognition and identification
*   identifies, names, writes and interprets numerals up to \(20\) (e.g. when shown the numerals \(4, 17, 9\) and \(16\) and asked, "which is \(16\)?", points to the numeral \(16\) or when shown the numeral \(17\) says its correct name; when role-playing simple money transactions, counts out  \(9\) one-dollar coins to pay for an item that costs  \(\$9\)
*   identifies and uses the \(1–9\) repeating sequence in the writing of teen numerals
*   identifies a whole quantity as the result of recognising smaller quantities up to \(20\) (e.g. uses part-part-whole knowledge of numbers to solve problems)
*   Developing place value
*   orders numbers from \(1–20\) (e.g. determines the largest number from a group of numbers in the range from one to \(20\); students are allocated a number between one and \(20\) and asked to arrange themselves in numerical order)
*   represents and describes teen numbers as \(10\) and some more (e.g. \(16\) is \(10\) and \(6\) more; uses ten-frames to represent teen numbers)

**Level 4**
*   Numeral recognition and identification
*   identifies, names, writes and interprets numerals up to and beyond \(100\) (e.g. is shown the numerals \(70, 38, 56\) and \(26\) and when asked "which is \(38\)?", identifies the numeral \(38\); writes \(18, 81\) and \(108\) with the digits in the correct position; compares the class sizes in a particular year level to determine which class has the greatest number of students)
*   identifies the \(1-9\) repeating sequence of digits, both in and between the decade numerals to order numbers and to predict the number that comes before or after another number (e.g. uses hundreds charts or vertical number lists)
*   identifies zero as both a number and a placeholder for reading and writing larger numerals, denoted by the numeral \(0\)
*   Place value
*   uses knowledge of place value to order numbers represented as numerals within the range of zero to at least \(100\) (e.g. locates the number \(21\) on a number line between \(20\) and \(22\); re-orders a set of numerals from least to greatest)
*   represents and renames two-digit numbers as counts of tens and ones (e.g. \(68\) is \(6\) tens and \(8\) ones, \(68\) ones, or \(60 + 8\); uses physical or virtual materials such as bundles of \(10\) tooth picks or base \(10\) blocks)

**Level 5**
*   Numeral recognition and identification
*   identifies, names, writes and interprets a numeral from a range of numerals up to \(1000\) (e.g. is shown the numerals \(70, 318, 576\) and \(276\) and when asked "which is \(276\)?’" identifies \(276\); compares the number of kilojoules in different energy drinks by reading the dietary information )
*   Place value
*   orders and flexibly renames three-digit numbers according to their place value (e.g. \(247\) is \(2\) hundreds, \(4\) tens and \(7\) ones or \(2\) hundreds and \(47\) ones or \(24\) tens and \(7\) ones)
*   applies an understanding of zero in place value notation when reading and writing numerals that include internal zeros (e.g. says \(807\) as \(8\) hundred and \(7\) or \(80\) tens and \(7\) ones, not \(80\) and \(7\))

**Level 6**
*   Numeral recognition and identification
*   identifies, reads, writes and interprets numerals beyond \(1000\) applying knowledge of place value, including numerals that contain a zero (e.g. reads \(1345\) as one thousand, \(3\) hundred and \(45\); reads one thousand and \(15\) and writes as \(1015\); compares the size of populations of schools, suburbs, cities and ecosystems or the cost of items in shopping catalogues)
*   Place value
*   represents, flexibly partitions and renames four-digit numbers into standard and non-standard place value partitions (e.g. uses grid paper to show the size of each digit in \(2202\); renames \(5645\) as \(3645\) and \(2000\) in order to subtract \(1998\))
*   estimates and rounds natural numbers to the nearest \(10\) or nearest \(100\) (e.g. pencils come in a pack of \(10\), so estimates the number of packs required for \(127\) Year \(6\) students; to check the reasonableness of their solution to the computation \(212 + 195\), rounds both numbers to \(200\))
*   represents and names tenths as one out of \(10\) equal parts of a whole (e.g. uses a bar model to represent the whole and its parts; uses a straw that has been cut into \(10\) equal pieces to demonstrate that one piece is one-tenth of a whole straw and \(2\) pieces are two-tenths of the whole straw)
*   represents and names one-tenth as its decimal equivalent (e.g. \(0.1\), zero point one)
*   extends the place value system to tenths

**Level 7**
*   Numeral recognition and identification
*   identifies, reads and writes numerals, beyond \(4\) digits in length, with spacing after every \(3\) digits (e.g. \(10\) \(204\), \(25\)  \(000\) \(000\); \(12\)  \(230.25\); reads \(152\)  \(450\) as "one hundred and \(52\) thousand \(4\) hundred and \(50\)"; compares the size of populations for different countries or the cost of expensive items with an advertised selling price in the millions)
*   identifies, reads and writes decimals to one and \(2\) decimal places (e.g. reads \(4.75\) as "four point seven five" or \(4\) and \(75\) hundredths; writes \(4\) dollars and \(5\) cents as \(\$4.05\))
*   Place value
*   estimates and rounds natural numbers to the nearest 10 thousand, thousand etc. recognising the multiplicative relationships between the place value of the digits (e.g. estimates the crowd numbers at a football match; says that the \(\$9863\) raised at a charity event was close to \(\$10\) \(000\); recognises that 200 years is 10 times as large as 20 years, and applies this to environmental change)
*   explains that the place value names for decimal numbers relate to the ones place value
*   explains and demonstrates that the place value system extends beyond tenths to hundredths, thousandths … (e.g. uses decimals to represent part units of measurement for length, mass, capacity and temperature)
*   represents, compares, orders and interprets decimals up to \(2\) decimal places (e.g. constructs a number line to include decimal values between zero and one, when asked "which is greater \(0.19\) or \(0.2\)?", responds "\(0.2\)" ; interprets and compares measurements such as the temperature on different days or the change in height of a growing plant observed and recorded during science investigations)
*   rounds decimals to the nearest natural number in order to estimate answers (e.g. estimates the length of material needed by rounding up the measurement to the nearest natural number)

**Level 8**
*   Numeral recognition and identification
*   identifies, reads, writes and interprets decimal numbers applying knowledge of the place value periods of tenths, hundredths and thousandths and beyond
*   Place value
*   compares the size of decimals to other numbers including natural numbers and decimals expressed to different numbers of places (e.g. selects \(0.35\) as the greatest number from the set \(0.2, 0.125, 0.35\); explains that \(2\) is greater than \(1.845\))
*   describes the multiplicative relationship between the adjacent positions in place value for decimals (e.g. understands that \(0.2\) is \(10\) times as great as \(0.02\) and that \(100\) times \(0.005\) is \(0.5\))
*   compares and orders decimals greater than one including those expressed to an unequal number of places (e.g. compares the heights of students in the class that are expressed in metres such as \(1.6\) m is taller than \(1.52\) m; correctly orders the numbers \(1.4\), \(1.375\) and \(2.15\) from least to greatest)
*   rounds decimals to one and 2 decimal places for a purpose

**Level 9**
*   Numeral recognition and identification
*   reads, represents, interprets and uses negative numbers in computation (e.g. explains that the temperature −\(10\) °C is colder than the temperature −\(2.5\) °C; recognises that negative numbers are less than zero; locates −\(12\) on a number line)
*   Place value
*   identifies that negative numbers are integers that represent both size and direction (e.g. uses a number line to represent position and order negative numbers; uses negative numbers in financial contexts such as to model an overdrawn account)
*   understands that multiplying and dividing numbers by \(10, 100, 1000\) changes the positional value of the digits (e.g. explains that \(100\) times \(0.125\) is \(12.5\) because each digit value in \(0.125\) is multiplied by \(100\), so \(100 \times 0.1\) is \(10\), \(100 \times 0.02\) is \(2\) and \(100 \times 0.005\) is \(0.5\); converts between units of centimetres and millimetres when planning, measuring and marking materials for cutting)
*   rounds decimals to a specified number of decimal places for a purpose (e.g. the mean distance thrown in a school javelin competition was rounded to \(2\) decimal places; if the percentage profit was calculated as \(12.467921\)%,  rounds the calculation to \(12.5\)%)

**Level 10**
*   Numeral recognition and identification
*   identifies, reads and interprets very large numbers and very small numbers (e.g. reads that the world population is estimated to be seven billion and interprets this to mean \(7 \) \(000\) \(000\) \(000\) or \(7 \times 10^9\); interprets the approximate mass of protons and neutrons as \(1.67 \times10^{-24}\)g; identifies and interprets the value of national government debt)
*   Place value
*   compares and orders very large numbers and very small numbers (e.g. understands the relative size of very large time scales such as a millennium)
*   relates place value parts to exponents (e.g. \(1000\) is \(100\) times greater than \(10\), and that is why \(10 \times 10^2 = 10^3\) and why \(10^3\) divided by \(10\) is equal to \(10^2\))
*   expresses numbers in scientific notation (e.g. when calculating the distance of the Earth from the sun uses \(1.5\times 10^8\) as an approximation; a nanometre has an order of magnitude of −\(9\) and is represented as \(10^{-9}\))

##### Counting processes

This sub-element describes how a student becomes increasingly able to count both verbally, through the stable order of a counting sequence, and perceptually through counting collections. As students make the link between counting ‘how many’ and the quantities represented by numbers, they begin to understand cardinality and the purpose of counting.

**Level 1**
*   Counting sequences
*   identifies number words when reciting counting rhymes or when asked to count (e.g. holds up \(3\) fingers to represent \(3\) little ducks)
*   Pre-counting
*   subitises small collections of objects, typically up to \(3\) items (e.g. recognises and names the number of dots on a card or how many fingers are held up out of one, \(2\) or \(3\))

**Level 2**
*   Counting sequences
*   counts in stable counting order from one within a known number range (e.g. engages with counting in nursery rhymes, songs and children’s literature)
*   Perceptual counting
*   conceptually subitises a collection up to \(5\) (e.g. recognises a collection of \(5\) items as a result of perceptually subitising smaller parts such as \(3\) and \(2\))
*   counts a small number of items typically less than \(4\)
*   engages in basic counting during play-based activities such as cooking or shopping (e.g. places \(3\) bananas in a shopping basket one at a time and says "\(1, 2, 3\)")

**Level 3**
*   Counting sequences
*   counts forward by one using the full counting sequence to determine the number before or after a given number, within the range of \(1–10\) (e.g. when asked what number comes after \(6\), counts from one in sequence up to \(7\) then says "it’s \(7\)"; when asked what number comes before \(6\), counts from one, \(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\) and responds "its \(5\)")
*   Perceptual counting
*   matches the count to objects, using one-to-one correspondence (e.g. counts visible or orderly items by ones; may use objects, tally marks, bead strings, sounds or fingers to count; identifies that \(2\) sirens means it is lunchtime)
*   determines that the last number said in a count names the quantity or total of that collection (e.g. when asked "how many" after they have counted the collection, repeats the last number in the count and indicates that it refers to the number of items in the collection)

**Level 4**
*   Counting sequences
*   uses knowledge of the counting sequence to determine the next number or previous number from a number in the range \(1–10\) (e.g. when asked what number comes directly after \(8\), immediately responds with "\(9\)" without needing to count from one)
*   continues a count starting from a number other than one
*   Perceptual counting
*   interprets the count independently of the type of objects being counted (e.g. a quantity of \(5\) counters is the same quantity as \(5\) basketball courts)
*   counts a collection, keeping track of items that have been counted and those that haven’t been counted yet to ensure they are only counted exactly once (e.g. when asked to count a pile of blocks, moves each block to the side as it is counted)

**Level 5**
*   Counting sequences
*   uses knowledge of the counting sequence to determine the next number or previous number from any starting point within the range \(1–100\)
*   Perceptual counting
*   matches known numerals to collections of up to \(20\), counting items using a one-to-one correspondence
*   uses zero to denote when no objects are present (e.g. when asked "how many cards have you got?" and has no cards left, says "zero")
*   counts objects in a collection independent of the order, appearance or arrangement (e.g. understands that counting \(7\) people in a row from left to right is the same as counting them from right to left)

**Level 6**
*   Counting sequences
*   continues counting from any number forwards and backwards beyond \(100\) using knowledge of place value
*   counts in sequence by twos and fives starting at zero (e.g. counts items using number rhymes "\(2, 4, 6, 8\) Mary’s at the cottage gate …"; skip counts in fives as "\(5, 10, 15, 20\)")
*   counts in sequence forwards and backwards by tens on the decade up to \(100\)
*   Perceptual counting
*   counts items in groups of twos, fives and tens (e.g. counts a quantity of \(10\)-cent pieces as \(10, 20, 30\) … to give the total value of the coins; counts the number of students by twos when lined up in pairs)

**Level 7**
*   Counting sequences
*   counts in sequence forwards and backwards by tens or fives off the decade to \(100\) and by hundreds up to \(1000\) and beyond using knowledge of place value (e.g. \(2, 12, 22\) … or \(8, 13, 18, 23\); \(100, 200\) … \(1000\))
*   Perceptual counting
*   counts large quantities in groups or multiples (e.g. groups items into piles of \(10\), then counts the piles, adding on the residual to quantify the whole collection)
*   estimates the number of items to count to assist with determining group sizes (e.g. decides that counting in twos would not be the most efficient counting strategy based on a quick estimate of the quantity and decides instead to use groups of \(10\))

**Level 8**
*   Counting sequences
*   counts forwards and backwards from any number
*   applies counting processes flexibly to count in rational numbers (e.g. counts in thirds such as \(\frac13\), \(\frac23, 1, 1\frac13, 1\frac23, 2\) …; starting from \(4\) counts backwards by \(0.3\) (e.g. \(4, 3.7, 3.4, 3.1\) …)
*   counts backwards from zero understanding that the count can be extended in the negative direction (e.g. \(0\), -\(1\), -\(2\), -\(3\), -\(4\))
*   Abstract counting
*   applies counting processes to quantify any type of conceivable collection (e.g. systematically counts the number of possible outcomes of an event; applies a frequency count; estimates and compares the difference between a word or character count in a text)

##### Additive strategies

This sub-element describes how a student becomes increasingly able to think additively, represent a wide range of additive situations and choose and use computational strategies for different purposes. The ability to understand the nature of change to a quantity where numbers are treated as the sum of their parts, is essential to become fluent users of number.

**Level 1**
*   Emergent strategies
*   describes the effects of "adding to" and "taking away" from a collection of objects
*   combines \(2\) groups of objects and attempts to determine the total

**Level 2**
*   Perceptual strategies
*   represents additive situations involving a small number of items with objects, drawings and diagrams
*   counts or subitises all items to determine the result when \(2\) collections are combined or when a quantity is taken away from a collection (e.g. when told "I have \(3\) red bottle tops in this pile and \(2\) blue bottle tops in this pile how many do I have all together?" counts each bottle top "One, \(2, 3\)" then "\(4, 5\)" responding "\(5\)")
*   changes a quantity by adding to or taking from an initial quantity, using physical or virtual materials or fingers
*   combines \(2\) or more collections of objects to form collections up to \(10\) and partitions collections of up to \(10\) items, to identify smaller quantities within the collection

**Level 3**
*   Figurative
*   solves additive tasks involving \(2\) concealed collections of items by visualising the numbers, then counts from one to determine the total (e.g. constructs a mental image of \(5\) and of \(3\) but when asked to combine to give a total, counts from one and may use head gestures to keep track of the count)

**Level 4**
*   Counting on (by ones)
*   represents and uses a range of counting strategies to solve addition problems such as counting-up-to and counting-up-from (e.g. to solve "I have \(7\) apples. I want \(10\). How many more do I need?" counts the number of apples needed to increase the quantity from \(7\) to \(10\); uses a counting on strategy to calculate \(6 + 3\), says "\(6, 7, 8, 9\) it's \(9\)"; to solve \(6\space + \space\) ? \(= 9\), says "\(6\) ... \(7, 8, 9\) it's \(3\)")
*   uses the additive property of zero, that a number will not change in value when zero is added to or taken away from it (e.g. when asked what is \(5 + 0\) the student responds "\(5\)")

**Level 5**
*   Counting back (by ones)
*   represents and uses a range of counting strategies to solve subtraction problems such as counting-down-from, counting-up-from, counting-down-to (e.g. to solve "Mia had \(10\) cupcakes. She gave \(3\) cupcakes away. How many cupcakes does Mia have left?" counts back from \(10\), "\(9, 8, 7\), Mia has \(7\) left"; to solve \(12\) take away something equals \(8\), responds "\(12\) take away one is \(11\), then \(10, 9, 8\), It's \(4\)")

**Level 6**
*   Flexible strategies with combinations to 10
*   describes subtraction as the difference between numbers rather than taking away using diagrams and a range of representations (e.g. using a number line to represent \(8\space–\space 3\) as the difference between \(8\) and \(3\))
*   uses a range of strategies to add or subtract \(2\) or more numbers within the range of \(1\)-\(20\) (e.g. bridging to \(10\); near doubles; adding the same to both numbers \(7 + 8 = 15\) because double \(8\) is \(16\) and \(7\) is one less than \(8\); \(8 + 6 = 14\) because \(8 + 2 = 10\) and \(4\) more is \(14\); \(15\space–\space 8 = 7\) because I can add \(2\) to both to give \(17\space–\space 10 = 7\))
*   uses knowledge of part-part-whole number construction to partition natural numbers into parts to solve addition and subtraction problems (e.g. to solve \(6\space +\) ? \(= 13\), says "\(6\) plus \(4\) makes \(10\), and \(3\) more ... so it’s \(7\)")
*   represents additive situations using number sentences and part-part-whole diagrams including when different parts or the whole are unknown (e.g. uses the number sentence \(8\space–\space 3 = 5\) to represent the problem "I had \(8\) pencils. I gave \(3\) to Max. I now have \(5\) remaining"; matches the number sentence \(4 \space+\space\)? \(= 9 \) to the problem, "I have \(9\) cups and only \(4\) saucers, how many more saucers do I need?")

**Level 7**
*   Flexible strategies with two-digit numbers
*   chooses from a range of known strategies to solve additive problems involving two-digit numbers (e.g. uses place value knowledge, known addition facts and part-part-whole number knowledge to solve problems like \(24 + 8 + 13\), partitions \(8\) as \(6\) and \(2\) more, then combines \(24\) and \(6\) to rename it as \(30\) before combining it with \(13\) to make \(43\), and then combines the remaining \(2\) to find \(45\); adds the same quantity to both numbers  \(47\space–\space38 = 49-40\))
*   identifies that the same combinations and partitions to \(10\) are repeated within each decade (e.g. knowing that \(8 + 2 = 10\), knows \(18 + 2 = 20\) and \(28 + 2 = 30\) etc.)
*   identifies addition as associative and commutative and that subtraction is neither
*   applies the commutative and associative properties of addition to simplify mental computation (e.g. to calculate \(23 + 9 + 7\) adds \(23\) to \(7\) to get \(30\), then adds \(9\) to give \(39\))
*   applies inverse relationship of addition and subtraction to solve problems, including solving problems with digital tools, and uses the inverse relationship to justify an answer (e.g. when solving \(23\space–\space16\) chooses to use addition \(16\space+ \space ? = 23\); when using a calculator to solve \(16\space+\space? = 38\) decides to use subtraction and inputs \(38-16\))
*   represents a wide range of additive problem situations involving two-digit numbers using appropriate addition and subtraction number sentences

**Level 8**
*   Flexible strategies with three-digit numbers and beyond
*   uses place value, standard and non-standard partitioning, trading or exchanging of units to mentally add and subtract numbers with \(3\) or more digits (e.g. to add \(250\) and \(457\), partitions \(250\) into \(2\) hundreds and \(5\) tens, says \(457\) plus \(2\) hundreds is \(657\), plus \(5\) tens is \(707\); to add \(184\) and \(270\) partitions into \(150 + 34 + 250 + 20 = 400 + 34+ 20 = 454\))
*   chooses and uses strategies including algorithms and technology to efficiently solve additive problems (e.g. develops total costings for ingredients or materials for a task or combines measurements to determine the total amount of materials required)
*   uses estimation to determine the reasonableness of the solution to an additive problem (e.g. when asked to add \(249\) and \(437\) says "\(250 + 440\) is \(690\)")
*   represents a wide range of familiar real-world additive situations involving large numbers as standard number sentences explaining their reasoning

**Level 9**

**Level 1**
*   Forming equal groups
*   shares collections equally by dealing (e.g. distributes all items one-to-one until they are exhausted, checking that the final groups are equal)
*   makes equal groups and counts by ones to determine the total

**Level 2**
*   Perceptual multiples
*   uses groups or multiples in counting and sharing physical or virtual materials (e.g. skip counts by twos, fives or tens with all objects visible)
*   represents authentic situations involving equal sharing and equal grouping with drawings and physical or virtual materials (e.g. draws a picture to represent \(4\) tables that seat \(6\) people to determine how many chairs they will need; uses \(8\) counters to represent sharing \(\$8\) between \(4\) friends)

**Level 3**
*   Figurative (imagined units)
*   uses perceptual markers to represent concealed quantities of equal amounts to determine the total number of items (e.g. to count how many whiteboard markers are in \(4\) packs, knows they come in packs of \(5\) and counts the number of markers as \(5, 10, 15, 20\))

**Level 4**
*   Repeated abstract composite units
*   uses composite units in repeated addition using the unit a specified number of times (e.g. interprets "\(4\) lots of \(3\)" additively and calculates \(3 + 3 + 3 + 3\) answering "\(12\)")
*   uses composite units in repeated subtraction using the unit a specified number of times (e.g. when asked "how many groups of \(4\) can be formed from our class of \(24\)?", repeatedly takes away \(4\) from \(24\) and counts the number of times this can be done. Says "\(20, 16, 12, 8, 4\) and zero so we can form \(6\) groups of \(4\)")

**Level 5**
*   Coordinating composite units
*   identifies and represents multiplication in various ways and solves simple multiplicative problems using these representations (e.g. represents multiplication as equal groups and arrays)
*   identifies and represents division in various ways such as sharing division or grouping division (e.g. to share a carton of \(12\) eggs equally between \(4\) people, draws \(12\) dots and circles \(3\) groups of \(4\) with \(3\) in each share)
*   identifies and represents multiplication and division abstractly using the symbols \(\times\) and \(÷\) (e.g. represents \(3\) groups of \(4\) as \(3 \times 4\); uses \(9 ÷ 3\) to represent \(9\) pieces of fruit being equally shared by \(3\) people)

**Level 6**

*   draws on the structure of multiplication to use known multiples in calculating related multiples (e.g. uses multiples of \(4\) to calculate multiples of \(8\))
*   interprets a range of multiplicative situations using the context of the problem to form a number sentence (e.g. to calculate the total number of buttons in 2 containers, each with 5 buttons, uses the number sentence \(2 \times 5 = \) ?; if a packet of \(20\) pens is to be shared equally between \(4\), writes \(20 ÷ 4 =\)  ?)
*   demonstrates flexibility in the use of single-digit multiplication facts (e.g. \(7\) boxes of \(6\) donuts is \(42\) donuts altogether because \(7 \times 6 = 42\); multiplying any factor by one will always give a product of that factor i.e. \(1 \times 6 = 6\); if you multiply any number by zero the result will always be zero)
*   uses the commutative and distributive properties of multiplication to aid computation when solving problems (e.g. \(5 \times 6\) is the same as \(6 \times 5\); calculates \(7 \times 4\) by adding \(5 \times 4\) and \(2 \times 4\))
*   applies mental strategies for multiplication to division and can justify their use (e.g. to divide \(64\) by \(4\), halves \(64\) then halves \(32\) to get an answer of \(16\))
*   explains the idea of a remainder as what is "left over" from the division (e.g. an incomplete group, lot of, next row or multiple)

**Level 7**
*   Flexible strategies for multiplication and division
*   uses multiplication and division as inverse operations to solve problems, including solving problems with digital tools and to justify a solution (e.g. when solving \(14\space\times\space\) ? \(= 336\) chooses to use division \(336 ÷ 14 =\space\) ? ; determines how long it will take to save up for a purchase and tests the effect of changing the amount saved each period)
*   uses known mental and written strategies such as using the distributive property,  partitioning into place value or factors to solve multiplicative problems involving numbers with up to \(3\) digits and can justify their use (e.g. \(7 \times 83 = 7 × 80 + 7 × 3\); to multiply a number by \(48\), first multiplies by \(12\) and then multiplies the result by \(4\); to solve \(16 \times 15\), uses double and half, such as \(16 \times 15 = 8 \times 30\))
*   uses estimation and rounding to check the reasonableness of products and quotients (e.g. multiplies \(200\) by \(30\) to determine if \(6138\) is a reasonable answer to \(198 \times 31\))

**Level 8**
*   Flexible strategies for multi-digit multiplication and division
*   solves multi-step problems involving multiplicative situations using appropriate mental strategies, digital tools and algorithms (e.g. uses a rate of application to determine the amount of paint required to cover a large area and determines how many tins of paint are required)

**Level 9**
*   Flexible strategies for multiplication and division of rational numbers
*   expresses a number as a product of its prime factors for a purpose

*   describes the effect of multiplication by a decimal or fraction less than one (e.g. when multiplying natural numbers by a fraction or decimal less than one such as \(15 \times\frac12 = 7.5\))
*   connects and converts decimals to fractions to assist in mental computation involving multiplication or division (e.g. to calculate \(16 \times 0.25\), recognises \(0.25\) as a quarter, and determines a quarter of \(16\) or determines \(0.5 ÷ 0.25\), by reading this as "one half, how many quarters?" and gives the answer as \(2\))
*   calculates the percentage of a quantity flexibly using multiplication and division (e.g. to calculate \(13\)% of \(1600\) uses \(0.13 \times 1600\) or \(1600 ÷ 100 \times 13\))
*   uses multiplicative strategies efficiently to solve problems involving rational numbers including integers (e.g. calculates the average temperature for Mt Wellington for July to be ˗\(1.6\) ˚C)

**Level 10**
*   Flexible strategies for working multiplicatively
*   uses knowledge of place value and multiplicative partitioning to multiply and divide decimals efficiently (e.g. \(0.461 \times 200 = 0.461 \times 100 \times 2 = 46.1 \times 2 = 92.2\))
*   flexibly operates multiplicatively with extremely large or very small numbers expressed in scientific notation (e.g. calculates the area of a computer chip measuring \(2.56 \times 10^{-6}\) m in width by \(1.4 \times 10^{-7}\) m in length)
*   chooses and uses appropriate strategies to solve multi-step problems and model situations involving rational numbers
*   represents and solves multifaceted problems in a wide range of multiplicative situations including scientific notation for those involving very small or very large numbers (e.g. chooses to calculate the percentage of a percentage to determine successive discounts; determines the time it takes for sunlight to reach the earth)

##### Interpreting fractions

This sub-element emphasises the development of fraction sense, which is foundational to learning how to reason proportionally. Students become increasingly able to recognise the part-whole description of a fraction, but also recognise and use fractions as numbers, measures, operators, ratios and as a division.

**Level 1**
*   Creating halves
*   demonstrates that dividing a whole into \(2\) parts can create equal or unequal parts
*   identifies the part and the whole in representations of one-half (e.g. joins \(2\) equal pieces back together to form the whole shape and can identify the pieces as equal parts of the whole shape)
*   creates equal halves of collections and physical and virtual materials using all of the whole (e.g. folds a paper strip in half to make equal pieces by aligning the edges; cuts a sandwich in half diagonally; partitions a collection into \(2\) equal groups to represent halving)

**Level 2**
*   Repeated halving
*   makes quarters and eighths of objects and collections by repeated halving (e.g. locates halfway on a strip of paper then halves each half; finds a quarter of an orange by halving and then halving again; \(8\) counters halved and then halved again into \(4\) groups of \(2\))
*   identifies the part and the whole in representations of halves, quarters and eighths (e.g. identifies the fractional parts that make up the whole using fraction puzzles)
*   represents known fractions using various fraction models (e.g. discrete collections, continuous linear and continuous area)

**Level 3**
*   Repeating fractional parts
*   accumulates fractional parts (e.g. knows that two-quarters is inclusive of one-quarter and twice one-quarter, not just the second quarter)
*   checks the equality of parts by iterating one part to form the whole (e.g. when given a representation of one-quarter of a length and asked, "what fraction is this of the whole length?", uses the length as a counting unit to make the whole)
*   identifies fractions in measurement situations and solves problems using halves, quarters and eighths (e.g. quarters in an AFL match; uses two \(\frac12\) cup measures in place of a single one-cup measure)
*   demonstrates that fractions can be written symbolically and interprets using part-whole knowledge (e.g. interprets \(\frac34\) to mean \(3\) one-quarters or \(3\) lots of \(\frac14\))

**Level 4**
*   Re-imagining the whole
*   creates thirds by visualising or approximating and adjusting (e.g. imagines a strip of paper in \(3\) parts, then adjusts and folds)
*   identifies examples and non-examples of partitioned representations of fractions
*   divides a whole into different fractional parts for different purposes (e.g. explores the problem of sharing a cake equally between different numbers of guests)
*   demonstrates that the more parts into which a whole is divided, the smaller the parts become

**Level 5**
*   Equivalence of fractions
*   identifies the need to have equal wholes to compare fractional parts (e.g. compares the pieces of pizza when \(2\) identical pizzas are cut into \(6\) and \(8\) and describes how one-sixth is greater than one-eighth)
*   creates fractions greater than one by recreating the whole (e.g. when creating four-thirds, demonstrates that three-thirds corresponds to the whole and the fourth third is part of an additional whole)
*   creates equivalent fractions by dividing the same-sized whole into different parts (e.g. shows two-sixths is the same as one-third of the same whole; creates a fraction wall)
*   uses partitioning to establish relationships between fractions (e.g. creates one-sixth as one-third of one-half)

**Level 6**
*   Fractions as numbers
*   connects the concepts of fractions and division: a fraction is a quotient, or a division statement (e.g. two-sixths is the same as \(2 ÷ 6\) or \(2\) partitioned into \(6\) equal parts or to solve "how to share 2 chocolate bars equally between \(3\) people", understands that it is \(2\) divided by \(3\), therefore each person gets two-thirds of a chocolate bar)
*   justifies where to place fractions on a number line (e.g. to show two-thirds on a number line divides the space between zero and one into \(3\) equal parts and indicates the correct location)
*   uses and explains the equivalence of decimals to benchmark fractions (e.g.\(\frac14 = 0.25\), \(\frac12 = 0.5\),  \(\frac34  = 0.75\),  \(\frac1{10}  = 0.1\), \(\frac1{100}  = 0.01\); converts cup measures to millilitres)

**Level 7**
*   Comparing fractions
*   understands the equivalence relationship between a fraction, decimal and percentage as different representations of the same quantity (e.g. \(\frac12  = 0.5 = 50\)% because \(5\) is half of \(10\) and \(50\) is half of \(100\))
*   identifies a fraction as a rational number that has relative size (e.g. describes a position as \(\frac23\) of the way up a ladder or varies a movement by performing it at half speed; understands "a quarter turn" as turning 90˚ rather than turning once every four steps
*   reasons and uses knowledge of equivalence to compare and order fractions of the same whole (e.g. compares two-thirds and three-quarters of the same collection or whole, by converting them into equivalent fractions of eight-twelfths and nine-twelfths; explains that three-fifths must be greater than four-ninths because three-fifths is greater than a half, and four-ninths is less than a half)

**Level 8**
*   Operating with fractions
*   adds or subtracts fractions with the same denominators and justifies the need for a common denominator
*   uses strategies to calculate a fraction of a quantity (e.g. to find a time-point two-thirds of the way through a music video or animation, determines one-third then doubles; locates a position a third of the way across the stage by measuring the width of the stage and dividing by \(3\))
*   explains the difference between multiplying and dividing fractions (e.g. recognises \(\frac12\times\frac14\) as one-half of a quarter and \(\frac12\) divided by \(\frac14\) as how many quarters are in one half)
*   expresses one quantity as a fraction of another (e.g. \(12\) defective items from the \(96\) that were produced represents one-eighth of all items produced)
*   demonstrates why dividing by a fraction can result in a larger number

**Level 9**
*   Operating with fractions proportionally
*   demonstrates that a fraction can also be used as a ratio to compare the size of \(2\) sets (e.g. if the colour ratio of a black and white pattern is \(2:3\), \(\frac25\)  is black and \(\frac35\) is white and the representation of black is \(\frac23\) of the white)

##### Proportional thinking

This sub-element addresses the proportional relationships between quantities. The ability to reason proportionally requires students to think multiplicatively and work with percentages, rates and ratios and proportions.

**Level 1**
*   Understanding percentages and relative size
*   explains that a percentage is a proportional relationship between a quantity and \(100\) (e.g. \(25\)% means \(25\) for every one hundred)
*   demonstrates that \(100\)% is a complete whole (e.g. explains that in order to get \(100\)% on a quiz, you must answer every question correctly)
*   uses percentage to describe, represent and compare relative size (e.g. selects which beaker is \(75\)% full, describes an object as \(50\)% of another object; describes and represents clean air as having \(21\)% oxygen)
*   recognises that complementary percentages add to give \(100\)% and applies to situations  (e.g. if \(10\)% of the jellybeans in a jar are black then \(90\)% are not black)

**Level 2**
*   Determines a percentage as a part of a whole
*   explains and fluently uses interchangeably the equivalence relationship between a fraction, decimal and percentage (e.g. \(\frac12  = 0.5 = 50\)%; explains that at quarter time, \(75\)% of the game is left to play; ; interchangeably refers to a response from \(50\)%, \(0.5\) or half of the audience when evaluating how an audience responded to an aspect of a performance)
*   uses key percentages and their equivalences to determine the percentage of a quantity (e.g. to solve \(75\)% of \(160\), knows that \(50\)% [half] of \(160\) is \(80\), and \(25\)% [quarter] is \(40\) so \(75\)% is \(120\))
*   calculates a percentage of an amount (e.g. interprets that a \(15\)% discount on an \(\$80\) purchase means \(15\)% \(\times \space\$80\) and determines \(10\)% \(\times\space\$80\) is \(\$8\), so \(5\)% \(\times\space\$80\) is \(\$4\) therefore \(15\)% \(\times \$80\) is \(\$8 + \$4 = \$12\); calculates the amount of sugar/fat in a breakfast cereal to make a recommendation on a healthy choice, such as \(12\)% of \(250\) grams = \(30\) grams)
*   expresses one quantity as a percentage of another (e.g. determines what percentage \(7\) is of \(35\); determines what percentage \(10\) millilitres is of \(200\) millilitres when calculating appropriate doses of medicine)
*   uses the complement of the percentage to calculate the amount after a percentage discount (e.g. to calculate how much to pay after a \(20\)% discount, calculates \(80\)% of the original cost)

**Level 3**
*   Identifies ratios as a part-to-part comparison
*   represents ratios using diagrams, physical or virtual materials (e.g. in a ratio \(1:4\) of red to blue counters, for each red counter there are \(4\) blue counters; uses physical or virtual materials to represent the ratio of hydrogen atoms to oxygen atoms in water molecules as \(2:1\), \(2\) hydrogen atoms for every oxygen atom)
*   interprets ratios as a comparison between \(2\) like quantities (e.g. ratio of students to teachers in a school is \(20:1\); ratio of carbohydrates to fat to protein in a food; interprets ratios such as debt equity ratio or savings-income ratio)
*   interprets a rate as a comparison between \(2\) different types of quantities (e.g. water flow can be measured at a rate of \(5\) litres per second; change of concentration of reactants per time; the relationship between beats per minute and the pulse/rhythm of a dance phrase)
*   expresses a ratio as equivalent fractions or percentages (e.g. the ratio of rainy days to fine days in Albany is \(1:2\) and so \(\frac13\) of the days are rainy; in a ratio of \(1:1\) each part represents one \(\frac12\) or \(50\)% of the whole; when interpreting food labels and making healthy eating choices)

**Level 4**
*   Using ratios and rates
*   uses a ratio to create, increase or decrease quantities to maintain a given proportion (e.g. creates mixtures such as adhesives, finishes, salad dressings; scales a recipe up or down; makes \(100\) litres of cordial given instructions for making \(5\) litres using one part cordial to \(6\) parts water)
*   uses rates to determine how quantities change (e.g. when travelling at a constant speed of \(60\) km/h, determines the distance travelled in \(30\) minutes; uses price rate of change to measure the direction and speed of a financial trend, such as an upward momentum in stock prices; compares the effect of different frame rates, frames per second, when producing a slow-motion sequence)

**Level 5**
*   Proportionality and the whole
*   determines the whole given a percentage (e.g. given \(20\)% is \(13\) millilitres, determines the whole is \(65\) millilitres; given \(20\)% is \(1300\) kilojoules, determines the whole is \(6500\) kilojoules when calculating the amount of energy consumed as part of a daily recommended intake)
*   identifies the common unit rate to compare rates expressed in different units (e.g. calculates best buys; compares the relative speed of \(2\) vehicles)
*   identifies, compares, represents and solves problems involving different rates in real world contexts (e.g.  measures heart rate and breathing rate to monitor the body’s reaction to a range of physical activities)
*   determines the equivalence between \(2\) rates or ratios by expressing them in their simplest form
*   describes how the proportion is preserved when using a ratio (e.g. uses the ratio \(1:4:15\) for the composition of silver, copper and gold to determine the mass of copper in a rose gold ring that weighs \(8\) grams; applies an aspect ratio when resizing images of an artwork such as if the aspect ratio is \(3:2\) then a picture that is \(600\) pixels wide would be \(400\) pixels tall)

**Level 6**
*   Applying proportion
*   recognises that percentages can be greater than \(100\)% (e.g. the entry price to the show has gone up from \(\$20\) last year to \(\$25\) this year, that’s  \(125\)% of last year's price; examines food labels and nutritional tables to determine whether the percentage a fast food meal exceeds a recommended daily intake for sugar/fats)
*   uses common fractions and decimals for proportional increase or decrease of a given amount
*   increases and decreases quantities by a percentage and expresses a percentage increase or decrease using a multiplier (e.g. calculates \(70\)% or \(0.7\) of the original marked price to apply a \(30\)% discount; multiplies by \(1.03\) when predicting a \(3\)% future capital gain; calculates percentage increase or decrease in international migration in Australia)
*   models situations uses percentages, rates and ratios (e.g. calculates interest payable on loans; compares taxation rates and the effect of a pay increase on how much annual income tax is payable; mixes chemical solutions using ratios; uses Mendelian inheritance to predict the ratio of offspring genotypes and phenotypes in monohybrid crosses)
*   identifies and interprets situations where direct proportion is involved (e.g. hours worked and payment received; increase in income and increase in demand for branded products; increasing the mass will increase the force provided that acceleration remains constant)
*   identifies and interprets situations where inverse proportion is involved (e.g. number of people working on a job and time taken to complete the job; speed and time taken to travel recognising that travelling at a greater speed will mean the journey takes less time; decrease in price and increase in demand)
*   uses ratio and scale factors to enlarge or reduce the size of objects (e.g. interprets the scale used on a map and determines the real distance between \(2\) locations; draws engineering drawings to scale)

**Level 7**
*   Flexible proportional thinking
*   identifies proportional relationships in formulas and uses proportional thinking flexibly to explore this relationship (e.g. recognises the proportional relationship between concentration and volume of a solution in the formula \(c=\frac nv\) and uses this relationship to make decisions when diluting solutions)
*   identifies, represents and chooses appropriate strategies to solve percentage problems involving proportional thinking (e.g. percentage of a percentage for calculating successive discounts; uses percentages to calculate compound interest on loans and investments; uses percentage increases or decreases as an operator, such as a \(3\)% increase is achieved by multiplying by \(1.03\), and \(4\) successive increases is achieved by multiplying by \((1.03)^4\) to make meaning of the formula

##### Number patterns and algebraic thinking

This sub-element describes how a student becomes increasingly able to identify and describe repeating and growing patterns in the environment and other everyday contexts. Students develop the capacity to generalise as they learn to recognise, represent, describe and use patterns for prediction and decision making.

**Level 1**
*   Recognises patterns
*   identifies and describes patterns in everyday contexts (e.g. brick pattern in a wall or the colour sequence of a traffic light)
*   identifies "same" and "different" in comparisons
*   copies simple patterns using shapes and objects
*   identifies numbers in standard pattern configurations without needing to count individual items (e.g. numbers represented on dominos or a standard dice)

**Level 2**
*   Identifying and creating patterns
*   identifies the pattern unit with a simple repeating pattern (e.g. identifies the repeating pattern red, blue, red, blue with red then blue; identifies the repeating patterns in everyday activities, days of the week or seasons of the year)
*   continues and creates repeating patterns involving the repetition of a pattern unit with shapes, movements, sounds, physical and virtual materials and numbers (e.g. circle, square, circle, square; stamp, clap, stamp, clap; \(1,2,3, 1,2,3, 1,2,3\))
*   identifies, continues and creates simple geometric patterns involving shapes, physical or virtual materials
*   determines a missing element within a pattern involving shapes, physical or virtual materials
*   conceptually subitises by identifying patterns in standard representations (e.g. patterns within ten-frames, uses finger patterns to represent a quantity)

**Level 3**
*   Continuing and generalising patterns
*   represents growing patterns where the difference between each successive term is constant, using physical and virtual materials, then summarising the pattern numerically (e.g. constructs a pattern using physical materials such as toothpicks, then summarises the number of toothpicks used as \(4, 7, 10, 13\) ...)
*   describes rules for replicating or continuing growing patterns where the difference between each successive term is the same (e.g. to determine the next number in the pattern \(3, 6, 9, 12\) … you add \(3\); for \(20, 15, 10\) … the rule is described as each term is generated by subtracting \(5\) from the previous term )
*   Relational thinking
*   uses the equals sign to represent "is equivalent to" or "is the same as" in number sentences (e.g. when asked to write an expression that is equivalent to \(5 + 3\), responds \(6 + 2\) and then writes \(5 + 3 = 6 + 2\)

**Level 4**
*   Generalising patterns
*   represents growing patterns where each successive term is determined by multiplying the previous term by a constant, using concrete materials, then summarises the pattern numerically (e.g. constructs a pattern using concrete materials such as tiles then summarises the pattern as \(2, 6, 18, 54\) ...)
*   describes rules for copying or continuing patterns where each successive term is found by multiplying or dividing the previous term by the same factor (e.g. to determine the next term in the pattern \(1, 3, 9, 27\) … multiply by \(3\))

*   uses relational thinking to determine the missing values in a number sentence (e.g. \(6 +\space\)  ?  \(= 7 + 4\))
*   uses equivalent number sentences involving addition or subtraction to calculate efficiently or to find an unknown (e.g. \(527 + 96 = \space\)? is the same as \(527 + 100\space – 4 = \space\)? ; If \(6 + \space\)? \(= 8 + 3\), then as I know \(8 = 6 + 2\), I can write \(8 + 3\) as \(6 + 2 + 3\), which is the same as \(6 + 5\) therefore ‘?’ is \(5\))
*   solves numerical equations involving unknowns using the inverse relationship between multiplication and division (e.g. determines the missing number in \(2 \times\space\) ? \(= 10\) knowing \(10 ÷ 2\) is equal to \(5\) then ? must be \(5\))

*   identifies and uses equivalence in number sentences to solve multiplicative problems involving numerical equations  (e.g. uses a number balance or other materials to represent the number sentence \(6 \times 4 = 12 \times \) ? in order to solve a problem)

**Level 6**
*   Representing unknowns
*   creates algebraic expressions to represent relationships involving one or more operations (e.g. when \(n = \) number of egg cartons, then the number of eggs can be represented by the expression \(12n\); to find the number of neutrons \(n\) given the atomic mass \(A\) and number of protons \(p\),  uses \(n = A - p\))
*   uses words or symbols to express relationships involving unknown values (e.g. total number of apples \(= 48\space\times\) number of boxes; \(C = 20 + 30h\) where \(C\) is the total cost and \(h\) is the hours of labour; uses \(v=\frac dt\) to represent the relationship between velocity, distance and time)
*   evaluates an algebraic expression or equation by substitution (e.g. uses the formula for force \(F\), \(F=ma\) to calculate the force given the mass \(m\) and the acceleration \(a\))

**Level 7**
*   Algebraic expressions
*   creates and identifies algebraic equations from word problems involving one or more operations (e.g. if a taxi charges \(\$5\) call out fee then a flat rate of \(\$2.30\) per km travelled, represents this algebraically as \(C=5+2.3d\) where \(d\) is the distance travelled in km and \(C\) is the total cost of the trip)
*   identifies and justifies equivalent algebraic expressions

**Level 9**
*   Linear and non-linear relationships
*   identifies the difference between linear and non-linear relationships in everyday contexts (e.g. explains that in a linear relationship, the rate of change is constant such as the cost of babysitting by the hour, whereas in a non-linear relationship the rate of change will vary and it could grow multiplicatively or exponentially such as a social media post going viral)
*   describes and interprets the graphical features of linear and non-linear growth in authentic problems (e.g. compares simple and compound interest graphs; describes the relationship between scientific data plotted on a graph; analyses a graph to identify the inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded or the relationship between Human Development Index (HDI) and standards of living)

The Measurement and geometry element includes 4 sub-elements.

These sub-elements are:

*   Understanding units of measurement
*   Understanding geometric properties
*   Positioning and locating
*   Measuring time

##### Understanding units of measurement

This sub-element describes how students becomes increasingly able to identify attributes that can be measured and the units by which they are measured. They initially use direct comparison to recognise and understand what it means to have more or less of a particular attribute, and progress to using informal, and then metric and other formal units.

**Level 1**
*   Describing the size of objects
*   uses gestures and informal language to identify the size of objects (e.g. holds hands apart and says "it’s this big")
*   uses everyday language to describe attributes in absolute terms that can be measured (e.g. "my tower is tall", "this box is heavy", "it is warm today")

**Level 2**
*   Comparing and ordering objects
*   uses direct comparison to compare \(2\) objects and indicates whether they are the same or different based on attributes such as length, height, mass or capacity (e.g. compares the length of \(2\) objects by aligning the ends; pours sand or water from one container to another to decide which holds more; hefts to decide which is heavier)
*   uses comparative language to compare \(2\) objects (e.g. states which is shorter or longer, lighter or heavier)
*   orders \(3\) or more objects by comparing pairs of objects (e.g. decides where to stand in a line ordered by height by comparing their height to others directly)

**Level 3**
*   Using informal units of measurement
*   measures an attribute by choosing and using multiple identical, informal units (e.g. measures the distance from one goal post to the other by counting out footsteps; chooses to count out loud to \(30\) to give enough time for people to hide in a game of hide and seek)
*   selects the appropriate size and dimensions of an informal unit to measure and compare attributes (e.g. chooses a linear unit such as a pencil to measure length, or a bucket to measure the capacity of a large container)
*   chooses and uses appropriate uniform informal units to measure length and area without gaps or overlaps (e.g. uses the same sized paper clips to measure the length of a line; uses tiles, rather than counters, to measure the area of a sheet of paper because the tiles fit together without gaps)
*   uses multiple uniform informal units to measure and make direct comparisons between the mass or capacity of objects (e.g. uses a balance scale and a number of same-sized marbles to compare mass; uses a number of cups of water or buckets of sand to measure capacity)
*   counts the individual uniform units used by ones to compare measurements (e.g. counts the number of matchsticks and says, "I used \(4\) matchsticks to measure the width of my book and the shelf is \(5\) matchsticks wide, so I know my book will fit")
*   Estimating measurements
*   estimates a measurement based on a number of uniform informal units  (e.g. estimates the measurement as "about \(4\) handspans" or it takes about \(2\) buckets of water)
*   checks an estimate using informal units to compare to predicted measurement

**Level 4**
*   Repeating a single informal unit to measure
*   measures length using a single informal unit repeatedly (e.g. uses one paper clip to measure the length of a line, making the first unit, marking its place, then moving the paper clip along the line and repeating this process)
*   measures the area of a surface using an informal single unit of measure repeatedly (e.g. uses a sheet of paper to measure the area of a desktop)
*   measures an attribute by counting the number of informal units used
*   Estimating measurements
*   uses familiar household items as benchmarks when estimating, length, mass and capacity (e.g. compares capacities based on knowing the capacity of a bottle of water such as, "it will take about \(3\) bottles to fill" )

*   recognises standard metric units are used to measure attributes of shapes, objects and events (e.g. identifies units used to measure everyday items; recognises that distances in athletic events are measured in metres such as 100 and 200 metre races)
*   uses the array structure to calculate area measured in square units (e.g. draws and describes the column and row structure to represent area as an array of square units, moving beyond counting of squares by ones)
*   estimates the measurement of an attribute by visualising between known informal units (e.g. uses a cup to measure a half cup of rice; determines that about \(3\) sheets of paper would fit across a desk, and close to \(6\) might fit along it, so the area of the desk is about \(18\) sheets of paper)
*   explains the difference between different attributes of the same shape or object and their associated metric units (e.g. length, mass and capacity)
*   Angles as measures of turn
*   describes the size of an angle as a measure of turn and compares familiar measures of turn to known angles  (e.g. the angle between the blades gets bigger as you open the scissors; a quarter turn creates a right angle)

**Level 6**
*   Using metric units
*   measures, compares and estimates length, perimeter and area of a surface using metric units (e.g. traces around their hand on centimetre grid paper and counts the number of squares to estimate the area of their hand print to be about \(68\) square centimetres)
*   uses scaled instruments to measure length, mass, capacity and temperature, correctly interpreting any unlabelled calibrations (e.g.  \(3\) marks between the numbered marks for kilograms means each gap represents \(250\) grams, so it’s divided into quarter kilogram intervals)
*   estimates measurements of an attribute using metric units (e.g. estimates the width of their thumb is close to a centimetre; compares the mass of \(2\) bags of fruit by hefting and says "this one feels like it weighs more than a kilogram"; approximates capacities based on the known capacity of a \(600\)-millilitre bottle of water)
*   Angles as measures of turn
*   compares angles to a right angle and classifies them as equal to, less than or greater than a right angle (e.g. directly compares the size of angles to a right angle, by using the corner of a book; uses reference to a right angle to describe body positions during a choreographed dance or when practising a skill for a particular sport)

**Level 8**
*   Converting units
*   converts between metric units of measurement of the same attribute (e.g. converts centimetres into millimetres by multiplying by \(10\); uses the consistent naming of metric prefixes to convert between adjacent units)

*   uses the conversion between units of volume and capacity to calculate the capacity of objects based on the internal volume and vice versa
*   identifies appropriate metric units to use according to the level of precision required (e.g. building plans show measurements in millimetres, but to purchase enough carpet you need to measure the length and width of the room and round up to the nearest whole metre)
*   uses and applies Pythagoras’ theorem to authentic contexts (e.g. determines the length of a cross brace given the width of a gate is \(1050\) millimetres and its height is \(1450\) millimetres)
*   uses and applies properties of congruent and similar triangles to authentic contexts to determine the size of unknown angles and lengths of sides

*   uses a calendar to identify the date and determine the number of days in each month

**Level 3**
*   Measuring time
*   uses standard instruments and units to describe and measure time to hours, minutes and seconds    (e.g. measures time using a stopwatch; sets a timer on an appliance; estimates the time it would take to walk to the other side of the school oval and uses minutes as the unit of measurement)
*   reads and interprets different representations of time (e.g. reads the time on an analog clock, watch or digital clock; uses lap times on a stop watch or fitness app)
*   identifies the minute hand movement on an analog clock and the \(60\)-minute markings, interpreting the numbers as representing lots of \(5\) (e.g. interprets the time on an analog clock to read \(7\):\(40\), by reading the hour hand and the minute hand and explaining how they are related)
*   uses smaller units of time such as seconds to record duration of events (e.g. records reaction times in sports or in relation to safe driving)
*   uses a calendar to calculate time intervals in days and weeks, bridging months (e.g. develops fitness plans, tracks growth and development progress and sets realistic personal and health goals using a calendar)

#### Statistics and probability

The Statistics and probability element includes 2 sub-elements.

The sub-elements are:

*   Understanding chance
*   Interpreting and representing data

##### Understanding chance

This sub-element describes how a student becomes increasingly able to use the language of chance and the numerical values of probabilities when determining the likelihood of an event and comparing chance events in relation to variation and expectation. Students recognise events may or may not happen and describe familiar events that involve chance, and progress to describe outcomes of chance experiments, develop an understanding of randomness, recognise bias, make predictions and explain why expected results may differ from the actual results of chance events.

**Level 1**
*   Describing chance
*   describes everyday occurrences that involve chance (e.g. chance of it raining tomorrow, choosing a name from a hat, making it to the grand final)
*   makes predictions on the likelihood of simple, everyday occurrences as to it will or won’t, might or might not happen, based on experiences (e.g. “the plant will die if we don’t water it”,  “next year I will be … years old”; “my tower might not fall down if I add one more brick but it won’t reach the roof”, “we might see a pelican at the lake”)

**Level 2**
*   Comparing chance
*   describes and orders the likelihood of events in non-quantitative terms such as certain, likely, highly likely, unlikely, impossible (e.g. "if there are more blue than red marbles in a bag, blue is more likely to be selected"; "I am certain that I won’t win the competition because I didn’t enter")
*   records outcomes of chance experiments in tables and charts
*   demonstrates that outcomes of chance experiments may differ from expected results (e.g. we will not get the same results every time we roll a dice)
*   draws conclusions that recognise variation in results of chance experiments (e.g. you rolled a lot of sixes this game, I hope I get more sixes next time)

**Level 3**
*   Fairness
*   identifies all possible outcomes of one-step experiments and records outcomes in tables and charts
*   explains why outcomes of chance experiments may differ from expected results (e.g. "just because there are \(6\) numbers on a dice doesn’t mean you are going to roll a \(6\) every \(6\) rolls, you may not roll a \(6\) in the entire game")
*   explains the difference between the notion of  equal likelihood of possible outcomes and those that are not equally likely   (e.g. explains the use of phrases such as fifty-fifty when there are \(2\) outcomes and when \(2\) events occurring are equally likely as opposed to head and tail are more likely than \(2\) heads or \(2\) tails)
*   identifies unfair elements in games that affect the chances of winning (e.g. having an unequal number of turns; weighted dice)
*   explains that the outcomes of chance events are either "certain to happen",  "certain not to happen" or lie somewhere in between and knows that impossible events are events that are "certain not to happen"
*   identifies events where the chance of one event occurring will not affect the occurrence of the other (e.g. if a coin is tossed and heads have come up \(7\) times in a row, it is still equally likely that the next toss will be either a head or a tail)

**Level 4**
*   Probabilities
*   expresses the theoretical probability of an event as the number of ways an event can happen out of the total number of possibilities
*   identifies a range of chance events that have a probability from \(0 – 1\) (e.g. you have zero probability of rolling a \(7\) with one roll of a standard \(6\)-sided dice; the probability that tomorrow is Wednesday given today is Tuesday is one)
*   describes probabilities as fractions of one (e.g. the probability of an even number when rolling a dice is \(\frac36\))
*   expresses probabilities as fractions, decimals, percentages and ratios recognising that all probabilities lie on a measurement scale of zero to one (e.g. uses numerical representations such as \(75\)% chance of rain or \(4\) out \(5\) people liked the story; explains why you can’t have a probability less than zero)

**Level 5**
*   Calculating probabilities
*   determines the probability of compound events and explains why some results have a higher probability than others (e.g. the results from tossing \(2\) coins)
*   represents diagrammatically all possible outcomes (e.g. tree diagrams, two-way tables, Venn diagrams)
*   measures and compares expected results to the actual results of a chance event over a number of trials, and compares and explains the variation in results (e.g. uses probability to determine expected results of a spinner prior to trial)
*   recognises that the chance of something occurring or its complement has a total probability of one (e.g. the probability of rolling a \(3\) is \(\frac16\) and the probability of not rolling a \(3\) is \(\frac56\)
*   calculates and explains the difference between the probabilities of chance events with and without replacement (e.g. "if we put all of the class names in a hat and draw them out one at a time without putting the name back in, the probability of your name getting called out increases each time because the total number of possible outcomes decreases")
*   calculates the probabilities of future events based on historical data (e.g. uses historical rainfall data to plan the date for an outdoor event)

**Level 6**
*   Probabilistic reasoning
*   recognises combinations of events and the impact they have on assigning probabilities (e.g. and, or, not, if not, at least)
*   solves conditional probability problems informally using data in two-way tables and authentic contexts
*   evaluates chance data reported in media for meaning and accuracy
*   applies probabilistic/chance reasoning to data collected in statistical investigations when making decisions acknowledging uncertainty

##### Interpreting and representing data

This sub-element describes how a student becomes increasingly able to recognise, use and interpret visual and numerical displays to describe data associated with statistical investigations, and to critically evaluate investigations by others. They learn to employ the sequence of steps involved in a statistical investigation: posing questions, collecting and analysing data, and drawing conclusions.

**Level 1**
*   Emergent data collection and representation
*   poses and answers simple questions and collects responses (e.g. collects data from a simple yes/no question by getting respondents to form a line depending upon their answer)
*   displays information using real objects, drawings or photographs (e.g. collects leaves from outside the classroom and displays them in order of size)
*   sorts and classifies shapes and objects into groups based on their features or characteristics and describes how they have been sorted (e.g. sorts objects by colour)
*   identifies things that vary or stay the same in everyday life (e.g. "it is always dark at night"; "although jellybeans are the same size, they can be different colours")

**Level 2**
*   Basic one-to-one data displays
*   poses questions that could be investigated from a simple numerical or categorical data set (e.g. number of family members, types of pets, where people live)
*   displays and describes one variable data in lists or tables
*   communicates information through text, picture graphs and tables using numbers and symbols (e.g. creates picture graphs to display one-variable data)
*   responds to questions and interprets general observations made about data represented in simple one-to-one data displays (e.g. responds to questions about the information represented in a simple picture graph that uses a one-to-one representation)

**Level 3**
*   Collecting, displaying and interpreting categorical data
*   designs survey questions to collect categorical data (e.g. creates a suite of survey questions to plan the end of year class party)
*   collects, records and displays one-variable data in variety of ways such as tables, charts, plots and graphs using the appropriate digital tools (e.g. uses a spreadsheet to record data collected in a class survey and generates a column graph to display the results)
*   displays and interprets categorical data in one-to-many data displays
*   interprets and represents categorical data in simple displays such as bar and column graphs, pie charts, models, maps, colour wheels, and pictorial timelines, and makes simple inferences from such displays
*   makes comparisons from categorical data displays using relative heights from a common baseline (e.g. compares the heights of the columns in a simple column graph to determine the tallest and recognises this as the most frequent response)

**Level 4**
*   Collecting, displaying and interpreting numerical data
*   collects and records discrete numerical data using an appropriate method for recording (e.g. uses a frequency table to record the experimental results for rolling a dice; records sample measurements taken during a science investigation)
*   constructs graphical representations of numerical data and explains the difference between continuous and discrete data (e.g. explains that measurements such as length, mass and temperature are continuous data whereas a count such as the number of people in a queue is discrete)
*   explains how data displays can be misleading (e.g. whether a scale should start at zero; not using uniform intervals on the axes)
*   interprets visual representations of data displayed using a multi-unit scale, reading values between the marked units and describing any variation and trends in the data

**Level 5**
*   Collecting, displaying, interpreting and analysing numerical data
*   poses questions based on variations in continuous numerical data and chooses the appropriate method to collect and record data (e.g. collects information on the heights of buildings or daily temperatures, tabulates the results and represents these graphically; uses a survey to collect primary data or secondary data extracted from census data)
*   uses numerical and graphical representations relevant to the purpose of the collection of the data and explains their reasoning (e.g. "I can’t use a frequency histogram for categorical data because there is no numerical connection between the categories"; converts their data to percentages in order to compare the girls' results to those of the boys, as the total number of boys and girls who participated in the survey was different)
*   determines and calculates the most appropriate statistic to describe the spread of data (e.g. when creating an infographic, uses the mean of the data to describe household income and the median of the data for house prices)
*   calculates simple descriptive statistics such as mode, mean or median as measures to represent typical values of a distribution (e.g. describes the mean kilojoule intake and median hours of exercise of a sample population when investigating community health and wellbeing; describes central tendency when analysing road safety statistics)
*   compares the usefulness of different representations of the same data (e.g. chooses to use a line graph to illustrate trends, a bar graph to compare the living standards of different economies and a histogram to show income distribution)
*   describes the spread of a data distribution in terms of the range, clusters, skewness and symmetry of the graphical display, and determines and makes connections to the mode, median and mean of the data

**Level 6**
*   Interpreting graphical representations
*   uses features of graphical representations to make predictions (e.g. predicts audience numbers based on historical data; interprets a range of graphs to identify possible trends and make predictions such as economic growth, stock prices, interest rates, population growth)
*   summarises data using fractions, percentages and decimals (e.g. \(\frac23\) of a class live in the same suburb; represents road safety and sun safety statistics as a percentage of the Australian population)
*   explains that continuous variables depicting growth or change often vary over time (e.g. creates growth charts to illustrate impacts of financial decisions; describes patterns in inflation rates, employment rates, migration rates over time; represents changes to fitness levels following the implementation of a personal fitness plan; interprets temperature charts)
*   interprets graphs depicting motion such as distance–time and velocity–time graphs
*   interprets and describes patterns in graphical representations of data from real-life situations such as the motion of a rollercoaster, flight trajectory of a basketball shot and the spread of disease
*   investigates the association of \(2\) numerical variables through the representation and interpretation of bivariate data (e.g. uses scatter plots to represent bivariate data when investigating the relationship between \(2\) variables, such as income per capita, population density and life expectancy for different socio-economic groups)
*   investigates, represents and interprets time series data (e.g. interrogates a time series graph showing the change in costs over time; uses a maximum daily temperature chart to determine the average temperature for the month)
*   interprets the impact of changes to data (e.g. recognises the impact of outliers on a data set such as the income of a world-class professional athlete on the average income of players at the state/territory level; uses digital tools to enhance the quality of data in a science investigation)

**Level 7**
*   Sampling
*   considers the context when determining whether to use data from a sample or a population
*   determines what type of sample to use from a population (e.g. decides to use a representative sample when conducting targeted market research or when researching beliefs about a health-related issue)
*   makes reasonable statements about a population based on evidence from samples (e.g. considers accuracy of representation of marginalised individuals or population groups)
*   plans, executes and reports on sampling-based investigations, taking into account validity of methodology and consistency of data, to answer questions formulated by the student

**Level 8**
*   Recognising bias
*   applies an understanding of distributions to evaluate claims based on data (e.g. recognises that the accuracy of using a sample for predicting population values depends on both the relative size of the sample and how well the characteristics of the sample reflect the characteristics of  the population; critically analyses statistics that reinforce stereotypes; evaluates claims made by the media regarding young people in relation to drugs and/or risk-taking behaviours)
*   identifies and explains bias as a possible source of error in media reports of survey data (e.g. uses data to evaluate veracity of review headlines such as "everybody’s favourite game"; investigates media claims on attitudes to government responses to market failure or income redistribution)
*   justifies criticisms of data sources that include biased statistical elements (e.g. inappropriate sampling from populations; identifying sources of uncertainty in a scientific investigation; checks the authenticity of a data set)
